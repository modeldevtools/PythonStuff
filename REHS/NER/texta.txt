CRICKET LEICESTERSHIRE TAKE OVER AT TOP AFTER INNINGS VICTORY
LONDON
West Indian Phil Simmons took four for 38 on Friday as Leicestershire beat Somerset by an innings and 39 runs in two days to take over at the head of the county championship
Their stay on top though may be as title rivals Essex Derbyshire and Surrey all closed in on victory while Kent made up for lost time in their match against Nottinghamshire
After bowling Somerset out for 83 on the opening morning at Grace Road Leicestershire extended their first innings by 94 runs before being bowled out for 296 with England discard Andy Caddick taking three for 83
Trailing by 213 Somerset got a solid start to their second innings before Simmons stepped in to bundle them out for 174
Essex however look certain to regain their top spot after Nasser Hussain and Peter Such gave them a firm grip on their match against Yorkshire at Headingley
Hussain considered surplus to England requirements struck 158 his first championship century of the season as Essex reached 372 and took a first innings lead of 82
By the close Yorkshire had turned that into a advantage but Such had scuttled their hopes taking four for 24 in 48 balls and leaving them hanging on 119 for five and praying for rain
At the Oval Surrey captain Chris Lewis another man dumped by England continued to silence his critics as he followed his four for 45 on Thursday with 80 not out on Friday in the match against Warwickshire
He was well backed by England hopeful Mark Butcher who made 70 as Surrey closed on 429 for seven a lead of 234
Derbyshire kept up the hunt for their first championship title since 1936 by reducing Worcestershire to 133 for five in their second innings still 100 runs away from avoiding an innings defeat
Australian Tom Moody took six for 82 but Chris Adams 123 and Tim 109 took Derbyshire to 471 and a first innings lead of 233
After the frustration of seeing the opening day of their match badly affected by the weather Kent stepped up a gear to dismiss Nottinghamshire for 214
They were held up by a gritty 84 from Paul Johnson but fast bowler Martin McCague took four for 55
By stumps Kent had reached 108 for three

SOCCER SHEARER NAMED AS ENGLAND CAPTAIN
LONDON
The world costliest footballer Alan Shearer was named as the new England captain on Friday
The who joined Newcastle for 15 million pounds sterling million takes over from Tony Adams who led the side during the European championship in June and former captain David Platt
Adams and Platt are both injured and will miss England opening World Cup qualifier against Moldova on Sunday
Shearer takes the captaincy on a trial basis but new coach Glenn Hoddle said he saw no reason why the former Blackburn and Southampton skipper should not make the post his own
I sure there wo be a problem I sure Alan is the man for the job Hoddle said
There were three or four people who could have done it but when I spoke to Alan he was up for it and really wanted it
In four days it very difficult to come to a 100 percent conclusion about something like this
but he knows how to conduct himself his team mates respect him and he knows about the team situation even though he plays up front
Shearer Euro 96 striking partner Teddy Sheringham withdrew from the squad with an injury on Friday
He will probably be replaced by Shearer Newcastle team mate Les Ferdinand

TENNIS TARANGO SPRING TWIN UPSETS UNDER THE LIGHTS
Larry Fine
NEW YORK
Andre Agassi escaped disaster on Thursday but Wimbledon finalist MaliVai Washington and Marcelo Rios were not so fortunate on a night of upsets at the Open
The Washington fell short of reprising his Wimbledon miracle comeback as he lost to wildcard Alex in a two hour 51 minute struggle on the Stadium court
Next door on the grandstand 10th seed Rios lost to another player with a Wimbledon connection bad boy Jeff Tarango
The temperamental defeated the Chilean
The day programme went smoothly although former champion Agassi had to wriggle out of a dangerous hole winning 18 of the last 19 games against India Leander Paes
But the night belonged to the upstarts
Washington who climbed back from a deficit two sets down in the third set against Todd Martin in the Wimbledon semifinals looked poised for another sensational comeback
a winner two weeks ago in New Haven for his first pro title served for the match at in the third set before Washington came charging back
I just kept saying to myself keep giving yourself the best chance to win keep battling maybe something will happen said the ranked 65th
I kept my composure and I was proud of myself for that usually I would have folded up the tent and gone home
The a former collegiate national champion fired up 17 aces to ultimately subdue the Washington
The fifth set stayed on serve until the sixth game when Washington after saving one break point with a forehand winner down the line netted a backhand to give a lead
The Texan blasted in two aces to hold serve at and then converted his eighth match point for victory when Washington found the net with another backhand from
You just kind of keep fighting and you keep trying to make him play a little bit
I think he got a little tight at a couple of moments said Washington
But I think he served pretty well when he had to
Tarango whose Wimbledon tantrum two years ago brought him a fine and suspension from this year tournament at the Club argued calls and taunted fans in his lively two hour 24 minute tango with Rios on the grandstand
A boisterous cheering section backed the distracted Chilean and booed the lanky American who ate up all the attention
I an emotional player said the Tarango
I think I played very well tonight very focused
The match turned on the tiebreaker which the American won much to the dismay of the spectators
I love the crowd if they boo me every day
It fires me up makes me play my best tennis Tarango said
I played some of my best tennis in college when fraternities were throwing beer on me
If tennis was like that every day I think everybody wold be having a lot more fun
Rios did not appreciate Tarango antics
He always complaining too much said Rios
But I think it not that
I think I played really bad
It was tough to play at night
Balls were going really fast
I lost too many points that I never lose
I did play my tennis
I do see the ball like I see during the day
I play an American so that why I play at night
I did feel good on the court
At the end of the match Tarango blew sarcastic kisses to the crowd then jiggled his body to a Rios rooting section in a jeering salute
I support their enthusiasm Tarango said about the fans
At the same time they cheering blatantly against me
After I won I figured I could give them a little

It was my best round in a very long time
My short game has improved since I had to use it so often
That always been the worst part of my game
All in all playing bad been a good experience

ROMANIA COMELF H1 PROFIT RISE BELOW TARGET
BUCHAREST
Romanian listed state engineer Comelf said it almost doubled output with net profit rising by 33 percent to billion lei
But the company complained inflation and the artificially high rate of the leu cut profit margins on exports keeping profits well below its forecast of billion lei
Comelf output rose to tonnes of equipment from tonnes in the equivalent period in 1995 the company report to the Bucharest stock exchange showed
Comelf based in the central Transylvanian town of Bistrita manufactures water purification equipment machinery for the thermal power sector and other equipment
In the first six months of 1996 we concentrated on increasing the volume of our output and exports in particular and improving the quality of our products the report said

Douglas Lomason shares rise on merger
FARMINGTON HILLS Mich
Shares of Douglas Lomason Co were up at Friday afternoon after Thursday announcement that the vehicle seat maker had agreed to be acquired by Magna International Inc for 31 a share or 135 million
Magna was up to on the New York Stock Exchange
Douglas Lomason has million common shares outstanding some of which are option shares to be purchased at exercise prices less than the 31 offered price
The acquisition will beef up Markham Magna North American car and truck seating business allowing it to better compete with Johnson Controls Inc and Lear Corp
Douglas Lomason which had 1995 revenue of 561 million was finding it more difficult to compete for new seating contracts from vehicle makers said James Hoey chief financial officer
Unfortunately in the auto industry these days a 500 million company is not a big company anymore Hoey said
This merger makes us much more competitive
He added that Douglas Lomason top executives have been asked to stay on with Magna after the merger though their future roles have not yet been defined
Douglas Lomason profits were hurt in the past year by model changeovers which had reduced production at some important customers but are now recovering analysts said
The company earned million on sales of 299 million in the first six months of 1996 up from earnings of million on sales of million
Ford plans to cut its roster of suppliers those it deals with directly in half over the next five years
The deal really levels the seating field somewhat said John Casesa of Schroder Wertheim Co
It should give Magna the critical mass to be a bigger player in that market
Magna traditional strength has been instrument panels door panels and other interior components
Magna Johnson Controls and Lear have been working to build up their capabilties to supply complete interiors to automakers including seats instrument panels door panels carpeting and headliners

Iraqi captors of Sudanese jet charged with hijack
LONDON
Seven Iraqis who seized a Sudanese airliner with 199 people aboard and forced it to fly to London were on Friday charged with hijack ending speculation that they might be offered immediate asylum in Britain
Police said the seven men who freed all their hostages after the plane landed at Stansted airport on Tuesday and then appealed for asylum would appear in court on Saturday
The Iraqis claimed they were ordinary people persecuted by the regime of Saddam Hussein but interior ministry officials had consistently said it was likely the seven would be charged with hijack before any plea for asylum was considered
Under English law the maximum sentence for hijack is life imprisonment but there has been widespread speculation that the seven will receive lesser sentences and then be allowed to stay rather than being sent back to Iraq
The hijack began on Monday when an plane was taken over shortly after it took off from Khartoum
The hijackers threatened to blow it up during a refuelling stop in Cyprus unless they were taken to London
After a search of the aircraft following the hijackers surrender police found only knives and fake explosives

MOSCOW
Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin said on Friday that President Boris Yeltsin who is vacationing outside Moscow had backed security chief Alexander Lebed peace plan for Chechnya Interfax news agency said
Lebed is now in Chechnya solving some problems Interfax quoted Chernomyrdin as saying
The main thing is his programme
It was agreed with Boris Nikolayevich Yeltsin yesterday
Lebed whom Yeltsin ordered to restore peace in Chechnya struck a military deal with separatist rebels last week ending the worst fighting in the region in more than a year
He later discussed with rebel Aslan Maskhadov a framework political agreement to tackle the most painful issue of the war the future political status of Chechnya
Lebed said on Friday he hoped to sign a document with the rebels later in the day which would deal with the political settlement of the conflict
Moscow which wants to keep Chechnya as a part of the Russian Federation sent troops to the region in December 1994 to quell its independence bid
Yeltsin has said any deal should preserve Russia territorial integrity
news agency quoted Lebed as saying that he would suggest to the rebels that the decision on Chechnya future political status be deferred by up to 10 years
Lebed said he had a telephone conversation with Yeltsin late on Thursday but gave no details
Yeltsin press office could not confirm the call
Chernomyrdin said on Thursday after a meeting with Lebed and top officials who discussed Lebed plans to restore peace in Chechnya that it needed more work

He gave no further details
That it the war is over Lebed told reporters who witnessed the signing
Lebed said he and Maskhadov agreed to defer by more than five years the painful issue of Chechnya political status
Then with cool heads calmly and soberly we will sort out our relations Lebed said after the signing ceremony in this settlement outside Chechnya eastern border
Tens of thousands of people have died in the war begun in late 1994 after Moscow sent troops to quell Chechnya independence bid
But Russia failed to win control over the whole of Chechnya and its troops suffered several humiliating defeats
President Boris Yeltsin ordered Lebed to restore peace in Chechnya and gave him unspecified sweeping powers to carry out the mission
Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin said on Friday that Yeltsin backed a package of proposals Lebed took to the talks
Ruling Moslem party ends vote boycott
SARAJEVO
Bosnia ruling Moslem nationalist party on Friday called on its refugee voters to end a boycott of absentee balloting in national elections citing assurances provided by a envoy government radio said
The Bosnian government radio broadcast said Assistant Secretary of State John Kornblum had reassured SDA officials including presumably its leader Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic whom he met during a Friday visit

Absentee voting in the elections began on Wednesday August 28 and runs for a week
Election day for those living inside Bosnia is September 14
The Party of Democratic Action SDA had called on Wednesday for its followers abroad to boycott the absentee balloting because of voter registration irregularities especially among Serb refugees
The Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe OSCE postponed municipal elections as a result of the irregularities but decided to proceed with voting for higher offices
The SDA joined by two other parties has been demanding that OSCE prohibit refugees voting from any place other than their place of residence as a means to prevent the elections from ratifying the results of ethnic cleansing

Top Belarus politician blasts president
Larisa Sayenko
MINSK
A senior Belarus politician accused President Alexander Lukashenko on Friday of attempting to set up a dictatorship in the former Soviet republic
The speaker of the Belarus parliament Semyon Sharetsky told Reuters that a draft constitution due to be put to a national referendum on November 7 would dangerously increase the powers of the ruler
The world community should not be indifferent to the fact that President Lukashenko who leads this European state of 10 million people is trying to establish a dictatorship with his new constitution Sharetsky said
The new constitution calls for a parliament with a house of representatives and a senate with a third of its members named by the president
Lukashenko aides shrugged off Sharetsky charge
If there was a dictatorship they would have the right to say things like this Sergei Posukhov Lukashenko political adviser told Reuters
The people have asked us to establish order and that our main aim
Lukashenko 41 won presidential polls in 1994 on promises to restore order fight corruption and repair the strong links with Russia that were disrupted by the collapse of the Soviet Union
But during his period in office he has battled against nationalist opponents trade unions and parliament and Sharetsky said the current parliament was ready to try to impeach him
This constitution which has been prepared in secret aims to gather all power in one man hands he said
We should not be fooled by his rhetoric and his methods like this referendum
Lukashenko signed a pact with Moscow in April to create a strong economic and political union which he believes could grow into a federation
But nationalist groups scared by the prospect of renewed Moscow domination and Russia backing for Lukashenko protested against the deal
Lukashenko responded by cracking down on the nationalist opposition and jailing nearly 200 people for taking part in demonstrations against the pact
The United States last week granted political asylum to two opposition leaders Zenon Poznyak and Sergei Naumchik

Yuri Kushko
TAVILDARA Tajikistan
Tajik government troops now control of the strategically vital town of Tavildara after driving out Islamic rebels but sporadic gunfire still echoed in the nearby Pamir mountains on Friday
The of Tajikistan armed forces Nikolai Sherbatov took a group of journalists by helicopter to the remote and now devastated town to show that his forces held it
He said his troops took Tavildara without casualties on August 23 but the crack of sniper and machinegun fire revealed the presence of opposition fighters in the surrounding mountains
Sherbatov said the rebels were located about three km two miles east of Tavildara around the village of Layron
Tavildara 200 km 120 miles east of the capital Dushanbe was in ruins
Shells had smashed roofs and windows and empty shell cases littered the streets
The town straddles a strategically important road linking government and territory and has fallen succesively to both sides in a bloody which began last February
Tajikistan which borders Afghanistan and China has been split by a dragging conflict after a civil war between communists and a frail coalition of Islamic and liberal groups
Tens of thousands of people have been killed and many more have been displaced in the fighting which breached a shaky United ceasefire
Tavildara is now apparently inhabited only by a few old men women and their grubby barefoot children
Fruit remained on the trees as there was no one to pick it
Help me help me said a chorus of women begging soldiers for food
The town school and a shop doubling as a warehouse for humanitarian aid were destroyed in the fighting
We had to build our own earth shelters to survive the fighting said Rajab Adinayev a bearded elderly Tajik in a long white shirt
Although shy in front of the government soldiers several inhabitants accused government forces of widespread looting of homes and livestock
They also said rebel fighters had looted medicines from the local hospital
One elderly man who declined to give his name said two of his sons were now refugees in Moscow and the other two had left to fight for the opposition
He also said government soldiers had raped the wife of one of his sons
It not important who holds this town we just need to stop the war he said

Twilight zone for Wall Street as political race heats up
Pierre Belec
NEW YORK
For Wall Street this is the season to be cautious as the presidential contest puts the stock market in the twilight zone
President Clinton Bob Dole and Ross Perot are hitting the road now that the partying is over and people who have billions of dollars invested in stocks were bracing for political promises that could have an impact on their wealth
Analysts believe that the candidates will add to the market list of uncertainties which already includes the question of whether the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates to cool economic growth
They say the politicians will need to promote legislation that helps the economy without scaring the socks off financial markets
The worst thing that could happen for financial markets is that if Clinton and Dole start to trade shots in the middle of the ring with said Hugh Johnson chief investment officer at First Albany That when Wall Street will need to worry
He said that the bond market would be the first to react if the bidding intensifies and stocks would quickly drop as interest rates rise
I do think it would imply the collapse of the stock market unless the rise in rates touches off a dynamic within the market which would include selling by portfolio managers redemptions by individuals of mutual funds that would in turn pressure the portfolio managers to sell even more stock
This week the market weighed Dole proposal to lower federal income taxes by 15 percent across the board a package that carries a price tag of 548 billion
Clinton proposes an billion agenda that would spare most from capital gains taxes and give employers tax incentives to hire people off the welfare rolls
Clinton claims Dole plan would increase the deficit while the White House said some corporate taxes would be raised to offset the cost of the president plan
The experts said there are some unusual risks for the market from this year political season because the rush to promise tax cuts to win votes could upset Wall Street expectations that Washington will balance the budget
The stock market will have to edit the promises and then do a probability study on those edited promises said John Geraghty at the consulting firm North American Equity Services
During the past four presidential elections the candidate that has favoured tax cuts has won
Ronald Reagan tax cut won him a second term in the White House in 1984 while Democrat Walter Mondale who promised higher taxes lost
George Bush became president in 1988 on his campaign and Clinton won in 1992 with a promise to fatten workers paychecks
The trick they said will be for the candidates to continue to convince Wall Street that the Treasury bond the most interest rate will fall to between 4 percent and 5 percent by the end of the decade
Johnson said that interest rates have already been spooked by the election
The bond jumped this week to percent after starting the year at percent
The surge of buying in stocks during the last two years has come amid an environment of low interest rates which has boosted corporate profits
But the market stalled this summer after the Dow Jones industrial average set a record high of points on May 22
The market does seem to be able to make new highs and it has been back and forth in a fairly horizontal mode which looks like a holding pattern said Geraghty
He said the market reflects the political uncertainty now that Dole has sharply narrowed the gap with Clinton in the polls
Geraghty said that the one thing that could completely turn the election around are new findings in the Whitewater scandal that would damage the Clintons
Stocks are on a delicate edge because if something happens that looks like it could upset the presidency it could throw the political and to some extent the economic process into chaos Geraghty said
Right now Wall Street is pondering the candidates
We have an election where there are so many unknown variables that most people will probably want to hold fire and even take the chance that they will have to pay higher prices for stocks after the November election than take the risk that a shock to the system will hurt the stock market Geraghty said

Brisk economic reports rattle markets anew
Glenn Somerville
WASHINGTON
Factory orders rose in July and manufacturing surged in the Midwest in August reports said Friday sparking worries about inflation that battered financial markets for a second straight day
The Commerce Department said orders for manufactured goods climbed percent in July to a seasonally adjusted billion nearly twice the increase that had been expected
Shipments of everything from new cars to food items rose as did order backlogs in a sign that the strength in the industrial sector would continue in coming months
A separate report from Chicago area purchasing managers underlined the strength in manufacturing as the group barometer of manufacturing in the region jumped to 60 in August from in July
A reading above 50 indicates growth in manufacturing
While production and orders rose at Midwest area businesses the prices they paid for goods used in manufacturing remained well in check
Analysts said the reports implied the economy was not slowing down in the third quarter after a burst of growth in the spring and that the lull in late June and July was more temporary than Federal Reserve had wanted
It appears that August is showing an economy again reversing course and is not moving onto a significantly slower track at this point said economist Lynn Reaser of Barnett Banks in Jacksonville Fla
The reports fanned worries on Wall Street that the Fed the nation central bank would raise rates next month in a bid to ward off inflation driving stock and bond prices sharply lower for a second day running
The Treasury fell almost a point raising its yield which moves in the opposite direction from the price to percent from percent late Thursday
The Dow Jones industrial average fell points to after a decline Thursday
A third report from the Commerce Department on July personal income and spending pointed to a potential slowdown in consumer spending that some analysts said may help moderate growth in the second half
It showed spending rose only percent last month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of trillion after dropping a revised percent in June
Incomes from wages salaries and all other sources gained percent to a rate of trillion after a percent jump in June
July slight gain in incomes was the weakest in six months since January when they were flat
Economist Joel Naroff of First Union bank in Philadelphia said consumer spending which fuels of the nation economy may be much slower in the third quarter than in the first half which should slow economic growth
The FOMC Federal Open Market Committee has been forecasting a slowing in economic activity and moderating household demand will have a large impact on overall economic growth Naroff said in a written comment
The FOMC is to meet on Sept
24 to plot strategy
It already has adopted a bias toward raising rates to keep a lid on wage and price rises and help sustain the economic expansion
In an interview on the cable television network CNBC Friday Federal Reserve Governor Lawrence Lindsey said there still were mixed signals about the economy direction
I think that on balance it is looking a little bit on the strong side Lindsey said
He added that with expansion as solid as it is and with unemployment so low the greater risks are clearly that we might see some overheating
While July consumer spending rose only slightly there were ample indications that consumers remained confident
The University of Michigan August index of consumer sentiment made available on Friday to paying subscribers rose to from in July
Reaser said strong consumer confidence coupled with relatively lean inventories were providing manufacturers with a reason to gear up production
The economy is not going to be expanding at the percent annual rate that we had in the second quarter but it is likely to keep expanding in the 3 percent range she said above the 2 percent to percent that the Fed considers to be
New orders to factories were strong for durable goods like new cars and for nondurables like paper and food products
Orders for durable goods meant to last three years or more rose a revised percent in July after falling percent in June
Orders for nondurables jumped percent following a percent decrease in June
Mexican avocados not expected in
Maggie McNeil
WASHINGTON
Agriculture Department officials said Friday that Mexican avocados which are restricted from entering the continental United States will not likely be entering markets any time soon even if the controversial ban were lifted today
The opportunity to import Mexican avocados probably wo become possible for another year said Paul Drazek senior trade advisor to Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman
We could lift the ban tomorrow but that would not mean anything immediately said Drazek
We probably would not see avacados come in until next season next November
The Agriculture Department proposed more than a year ago to significantly ease an ban on Mexican avocados
Under the administration proposal the borders to the Mexican produce would be opened into 19 Northern and Northeastern states from November through February
The plan has raised a storm of protest from avocado growers who are largely concentrated in California
California growers have charged that removing the restrictions even on a limited basis would endanger the 1 billion industry if potentially harmful Mexican insects were brought into the country along with the avocados
Mexican officials contend that there is no scientific basis for the ban and that it is illegal under international trading rules of the World Trade Organisation
Proponents of the plan discount the worries of the growers and say the plan has enough safeguards built into it to eliminate any significant threat to American producers
Under the proposal only imports of avocados growing in approved orchards in Michoacan Mexico the country main avocado area would be allowed
Mexican growers and distributors would have to abide by strict rules established by the Mexican and agriculture agencies
The California Avocado Commission which has spearheaded the opposition to lifting the ban said new data the group submitted to the Agriculture Department last spring shows the department underestimated the pest problem in Mexico and have urged that the agency reopen its study of the issue
The administration is still studying the new data and officials have said that if experts think the information is significant the agency could reopen its investigation
But avocado industry sources said that while they may have delayed the plan for a while they ultimately do not expect the administration to change its position
From a view the department should reconsider this plan but due to politics they will probably go ahead with this said Tom Bellamore of the California avocado group
Administration officials said they want to get the issue resolved as quickly as possible but said there is no timetable they are working under
It a very complicated issue said the Agriculture Department Drazek
We get it resolved as quickly as we can based on the best available science
Cardinal Bernardin says has terminal cancer
CHICAGO
Chicago Cardinal Joseph Bernardin head of the Roman Catholic archdiocese said on Friday his doctors had diagnosed him as having liver cancer and he had a year or less to live
Bernardin 68 underwent extensive surgery for pancreatic cancer in June 1995 followed by months of chemotherapy which he said made him more aware of his own vulnerabilities and the need to minister to the sick
On Wednesday examinations indicated that the cancer has returned this time in the liver
I am told that it is terminal and that my life expectancy is one year or less a composed Bernardin told a news conference
In 14 years as Chicago archbishop he built a prayerful saintly image and was deeply involved in world church issues and publicly committed to rooting out abuses by clergy
I have been assured that I still have some quality time left he said saying he would undergo a new form of chemotherapy but his doctors have told him there was only a slim chance of a cure and the liver cancer was inoperable
It not going to be easy to say goodbye to everybody
Death does have some sad dimensions to it but I am a man of faith he said
Death is a natural phenomenom
He said he would serve until the end as cardinal
Pancreatic cancer is among the most deadly forms of the disease although Bernardin case was caught early
Surgeons removed a cancerous kidney parts of his pancreas and stomach small intestine bile duct and surrounding tissues
He made a rapid recovery and resumed most of his duties but then developed a deteriorating condition in his spine that caused him great pain and shortened his height by several inches
He was scheduled to undergo back surgery next month but that was cancelled when the cancer was discovered in his liver in order to avoid delaying the start of chemotherapy
The spare son of an Italian stonecutter took over the Chicago archdiocese the nation after Los Angeles with million parishioners in 1982
Ironically Bernardin who developed a progressive programme to deal with pedophilia involving priests became the church official ever accused of sexual improprieties when a former seminary student leveled charges in 1993 that he had been sexually abused by Bernardin during the 1970s
Bernardin steadfastly denied the charges and the former student later recanted his tale of abuse
Bernardin prayed with him before he died from AIDS last year
Bernardin who became archbishop of Cincinnati in 1972 played an increasingly prominent role in the church as a moderate voice of compromise among liberals and conservatives in the ranks of the bishops
This month he announced that he would oversee a series of conferences to find common ground among American Catholics
Previously he was instrumental in drafting church policy on war peace and nuclear arms and for seven years he headed the bishops policy committee espousing a policy describing human life as a seamless garment
Boatmen deal could spark more mergers
Brad Dorfman
CHICAGO
The billion proposed acquisition of Boatmen Bancshares by NationsBank could spark a flurry of other mergers involving Missouri banks which until last year were protected from outside buyers by state regulations
NationsBank just strolled into the Midwest and bagged the biggest banking trophy in the landscape said Michael Ancell banking industry analyst at Edward Jones Co
Whoever wants a big market position in the Midwest has to come in and grab Mercantile or Commerce
Mercantile Bancorp a bank holding company with billion in assets was seen by many analysts as the most attractive Missouri franchise in size after Boatmen
Kansas City Commerce Bancshares with billion in assets also could help a regional bank establish a strong presence in the lower Midwest analysts added
It focuses more attention on Mercantile Commerce and Roosevelt said James Weber analyst at Edwards Sons
Roosevelt Financial Group Inc is a billion
Louis based thrift
Now the most coveted bank out there is Mercantile Weber said
Mercantile and Commerce did not return phone calls seeking comment
Among those seen as having an interest in buying in Missouri are First Bank System and Norwest KeyCorp and Banc One and First Chicago NBD in Illinois
Representatives of First Bank Norwest Banc One and First Chicago said the banks do not comment on rumors of possible mergers or acquisitions
KeyCorp contacted by phone would not comment
With a presence in nine states and 41 billion in assets
Boatmen was the prize in Missouri where barriers to outside acquirers were brought down last year by a federal banking statute
Boatmen was the plum of Missouri and was the plum of the central Midwest Weber said
Talk that the Missouri banks were seeking inflated prices from buyers was seen as a reason a deal has not occurred sooner
But NationsBank bid representing a premium of 40 percent for Boatmen stock was large enough to get the deal done
I think Boatmen was shopping itself and everybody knew if you wanted to be the winning buyer here you had to make the bid nobody would beat Ancell said
But some analysts cautioned that other targets should not expect as large a premium
They also questioned whether NationsBank can recoup shareholder value with such a large bid for Boatmen
I think initially some stocks will trade up on sympathy but the wild premium NationsBank put on this deal here I do see a lot of other deals being done at this premium said Michael Durante analyst at McDonald Co
on Libya award to Farrakhan
WASHINGTON
The State Department refused to speculate on Friday on what might happen in the case of Louis Farrakhan the black leader who was awarded a human rights prize by Libya
I not going to speculate about what may or may not happen in that case State Department spokesman Glyn Davies said
The view of the government on Farrakhan not accepting any gifts from Libya is
Davies also noted We talked about the passport restriction for travel to Libya but he did not elaborate
The Treasury Department on Wednesday denied Farrakhan application to receive the award or a 1 billion donation Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi had pledged to Farrakhan Nation of Islam group after they met last January
Farrakhan organised last October Million Man March that brought thousands of black men to Washington for a peaceful rally
The Treasury Department said Libya was on the list of states that sponsor international terrorism and noted that Tripoli has refused to hand over two Libyan suspects in the 1988 bombing of Pan Am flight 103 over Lockerbie Scotland
That refusal led to the imposition of sanctions on Libya

Titanic recovery mission is scrapped
NEW YORK
Equipment problems and mechanical failure forced a recovery expedition to give up efforts to retrieve a giant slab of the RMS Titanic from the ocean floor a spokeswoman said on Friday
A piece of the Titanic steel hull which had been attached by cables to a recovery ship off the coast of Newfoundland Canada fell back to the bottom of the sea said Erin Purcell of Reagan Communications that represents two of the ships used in the expedition
The piece of hull lifted from the ocean floor by means of several bags had been stuck about 200 feet about 70 metres below the water surface before it fell she said
It fell as recovery crews were trying to haul the piece into more shallow water and several of the bags burst and cables snapped she said
The Titanic thought to be unsinkable struck an iceberg on April 14 1912 and sank killing of the passengers and crew on board
The wreck was located in 1985
Passengers who had paid and up to accompany the recovery expedition on two cruise ships had returned back to port on Thursday Purcell said
Bonn appeals for Middle East peace
BONN
The German government urged Israelis and Palestinians on Friday to avoid any course of action that might jeopardise the peace process in the Middle East
Israel announced this week the expansion of Jewish West Bank settlements surrounding Jerusalem and the demolition of an Arab community centre in East Jerusalem
City officials there said the centre was being erected illegally
But Palestinian President Yasser Arafat said the moves by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu government were tantamount to war
Tension has been rising in the region since
We believe that the Israeli settlement policy in the occupied areas is an obstacle to the establishment of peace German Foreign Ministry spokesman Martin Erdmann said
All concerned must avoid taking any course of action that could pose an obstacle to the peace process and which could make a peaceful solution difficult he said as news came of a renewed breakdown in peace talks in Jerusalem
Erdmann told reporters Bonn supported European Union efforts to persuade Israel to stop further Jewish settlement on the West Bank
The foreign ministry later announced Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy would visit Bonn for talks with his German counterpart Klaus Kinkel next month
The ministry said Levy and Kinkel would discuss the Middle East process and relations at their meeting on September 9
Levy visit would be the first by an Israeli cabinet minister since Netanyahu conservative government took power in une this year the ministry said
Before Levy arrival in Bonn German Defence Minister Volker Ruehe will visit Israel from September 2 to 4 the defence ministry said
Ruehe planned to meet his Israeli counterpart Yitzhak Mordechai and Israeli President Ezer Weizman the ministry said
He was also expected to meet Prime Minister Netanyahu and opposition leader Shimon Peres for talks

Legislation is insufficient in several areas notably in those concerning illegal work Juppe told reporters

Syria slams Israel on settlements
DAMASCUS
Syria on Friday condemned Israel settlement policy and said Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was preparing for war with Arabs
Practices of the Israeli government especially its settlement activities came to confirm that dealing with this government inflicts the biggest harm on the Arab cause Damascus Radio said in a commentary
When this government insists on stabbing the peace process and tearing it apart this means that it is preparing for war the radio said
Palestinian President Yasser Arafat described this week the decision to expand settlements in the West Bank as a declaration of war
Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza observed a strike on Thursday to protest against the Israeli move
The radio urged Arabs to unify their ranks to thwart the policies of the Israeli government
Israel could not confront a united Arab stand or usurp their rights because the Arab rights could be regained when they achieve unity and solidarity Damascus radio said
It welcomed the international criticism of Israel settlement policies but called for practical steps to force the Israeli government to abandon this policy
It is important to translate the criticism into pressuring action to prevent Israel from undermining the big international efforts aimed at making the peace process achieve success the radio said
Syria and Arabs have been dismayed by Netanyahu refusal to trade the occupied Arab lands for peace his support for the expansion of settlements and his insistance on Jerusalem as a unifed capital for Israel
Syria has held sporadic peace talks with Israel since 1991 without achieving a breakthrough
Egypt police detain 26 suspected Moslem militants
CAIRO

State security officials were not immediately available for comment
More than 960 people have been killed in the armed struggle the launched in 1992 to topple President Hosni Mubarak government and establish a purist Islamic state in its place
Israel blocks Palestinian pilgrims progress
Sami Aboudi
West Bank
Kamil Jamil did have a prayer
An Israeli roadblock stopped the Palestinian from answering Yasser Arafat call to worship at Jerusalem mosque on Friday
Go home
There are no prayers today an Israeli soldier yelled at Jamil in Hebrew
Palestinian President Arafat attacking Israel decision to expand Jewish settlements and its policy on Jerusalem went before the Palestinian legislature on Wednesday to urge the two million Arabs in the West Bank and Gaza to go to the holy city
Pilgrims stood little chance of making progress
Palestinians have been banned by Israel from travelling from the West Bank to Jerusalem since suicide bombings by Moslem militants killed 59 people in the Jewish state in February and March
And Israeli checkpoints have circled Jerusalem since 1993 a concrete and constant reminder of Israel hold on a city it considers its eternal capital
The PLO wants Arab East Jerusalem as the capital of a future Palestinian state
Only a few Palestinians trickled to the roadblocks
They were immediately turned back
I am heeding Abu Ammar Arafat call to pray at and I came
It is our duty towards to come and pray Jamil said
A tourist from Jordan was also told by Israeli soldiers at the checkpoint that he could not enter Jerusalem
We have a peace treaty with them and we let them go wherever they want when they come to Jordan said the tourist Khaled Hijazi 37
I feel terrible
I am entitled to see Jerusalem he said
Some Palestinians took to back roads only to run into waiting Israeli security forces
The Israelis have no right to prevent us from going to pray
What kind of peace is this that prevents us from reaching our holy places
asked Mustafa Hoshiyeh a West Bank labourer turned around by a police patrol on a back road
Abu Ammar Arafat is right
We have signed a peace treaty with the Israelis but on the ground we see that nothing has changed said Ali Ahmed from Qalandia refugee camp

Consumer spending incomes edge up in July
Glenn Somerville
WASHINGTON
Consumer spending barely edged up in July the Commerce Department said Friday as income growth slowed abruptly to the weakest pace in six months
Spending rose percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of trillion after dropping a revised percent in June
Incomes from wages salaries and all other sources gained percent to a rate of trillion after a percent jump in June
Department officials said July slight gain in incomes was the weakest for any month since January when they were flat
Wages and salaries came under pressure in July as a shorter average workweek and lower hourly earnings cut into paychecks
The department said wages and salaries decreased by billion in July after climbing 45 billion in June
In July average weekly hours and average hourly earnings declined more than offsetting the effect of an increase in employment Commerce said
But more money went into savings accounts as savings held at cents out of each dollar earned in both June and July
That was the highest savings rate since October last year when cents out of each dollar earned was being saved
The generally lackluster report on spending and incomes in July had been expected
At the same time the department said in a separate report that new orders received by factories climbed strongly in July with widespread gains across most major categories
Orders increased percent to a seasonally adjusted billion significantly stronger than the 1 percent rise forecast by Wall Street economists
That followed a revised percent decline in June orders
Commerce said previously that spending at retail stores was up only percent in July partly because of softer sales of new cars and light trucks
In addition the Labour Department July employment report had foreshadowed the muted income growth
It showed average hourly earnings fell in July by percent to and the average workweek shortened to hours from in June
Gains in personal income which includes wages and salaries as well as income from sources such as dividends interest and businesses are essential for funding consumer purchases which fuel of national economic activity
Spending on all types of durable goods which includes cars fell to an annual rate of billion in July from billion in June
But spending on nondurable products increased moderately to a rate of trillion from trillion in June while spending for services was up to trillion in July from trillion
Payrolls of manufacturing companies rose in July by billion to an annual rate of 678 billion

There are more worries in bond land
Fears of a Fed tightening next month have resurfaced for the first time since the end of July
The Commerce Department reported that the nation gross domestic product expanded at a percent annual rate in the three months from April through June instead of the percent estimated a month ago
In another report sales of new homes jumped unexpectedly in July to the briskest rate in five months driving prices up in a strong housing market
Sales shot up percent last month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of units the strongest since February when new homes were selling at a rate of a year
Analysts said the stock market was also worried about the impact on President Clinton bid of his top political strategist resigning
Dick Morris who is credited with resurrecting Clinton political fortunes over the past 18 months by masterminding his turn to the political centre quit after a supermarket tabloid reported he engaged in a yearlong affair with a prostitute with whom he allegedly shared confidential campaign documents
Analysts said Wall Street had grown accustomed to a moderate Republican in the form of Democratic President Clinton
Morris departure raised fears that Clinton would veer more to the left in a second term

Pirelli cables look to tap Chinese growth
David Jones
MILAN
Italian tyre and cables giant Pirelli on Friday announced its move into China with a cables joint venture set to capitalise on the Chinese telecommunications market
Pirelli is linking with Hong group CITIC Pacific in a venture to be called the Wuxi Tong Ling Company Ltd which will operate in partnership with a local industrial company at its existing factory in Wuxi Jiangsu province Shanghai
The partners will invest around 30 million in the existing copper cable plant at Wuxi to update technology and include optic fibre production with annual turnover expected to reach 60 million within the next few years
The move marks a further move by Pirelli cables division to expand in the Far Eastern developing markets with the group already present in Indonesia India and Malaysia
This is really positive news for Pirelli and I expect that it will produce one of the best results in late September compared to other industrial Italian companies said analyst Paula Buratti at Indosuez
She emphasised that the move was positive because Pirelli will have management control of the Chinese venture and it also showed another example of Pirelli exporting its technical to developing markets
Pirelli shares reacted favourable even though talks had been underway for some time and news about a venture had been widely expected
The shares rose percent to lire by 1350 GMT in an easier Milan stock market
This will be Pirelli first industrial involvement in a Chinese market where demand for telecommunication networks is expected to grow to million new lines between 1996 and 2000 doubling demand for optical cables
China second largest telecoms operator Unicom already has a mandate from the central government to establish 15 million new phone lines by the year 2000 which will necessitate new trunk line systems and local distribution networks
The starting of this production base in China has for our group an undoubted strategic value representing an important enhancement of our presence in Asia said Pirelli SpA chairman and chief executive officer Marco Tonchetti Provera
Pirelli Cables has global sales of over billion and has become a large supplier of optic cables and systems to major telecoms carriers in the Europe and the Far East
CITIC Pacific is a major Hong company focusing on infrastruture trading distribution and property with 28 percent of its 1995 profits coming from telecoms
It has investments in several industrial joint ventures in China
Dutch bond futures revival delayed EOE
AMSTERDAM
A broad attempt to spur activity in Dutch bond futures has been delayed to give participants a chance to become familiar with the trading system the European Options Exchange EOE said on Friday
in the FTO contract was expected to begin today but an EOE spokesman said the 10 banks and brokers involved in the initiative needed time to get accustomed to changes in the electronic trading system
It not ready yet
We found it wise to take some time between the commitment to start and the actual start EOE spokesman Lex van Drooge told Reuters
He said no date had been fixed yet for the start of price making in the contract but the EOE had agreed to speak again to the participants in one to two weeks
Investors in Dutch bonds currently use German bond futures to hedge their portfolios because the FTO contract is so illiquid
A limited attempt to reinvigorate the contract two years ago failed

OSCE defends record over Chechnya peace mission
BONN
The head of an international mediating mission defended its record on Friday in the face of criticism by leaders in breakway Chechnya and insisted it was doing its best to bring peace to the region
Flavio Cotti the chairman of the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe OSCE told German radio the body viewed the conflict in Chechnya as an internal Russian problem
The OSCE is completely involved
But one must not forget that the OSCE only has limited powers there said Cotti who is also the Swiss foreign minister
Our mission in Chechnya has done all it can within the given limitations
leaders in Chechnya have criticised Tim Guldimann the Swiss diplomat who heads the OSCE Chechnya mission saying he was biased toward Zelimkhan Yandarbiyev president of the separatist government
Russian peacemaker Alexander Lebed and Chechen separatist military leader Aslan Maskhadov started a new round of peace talks on Friday just outside the rebel region
Cotti said Chechnya must remain part of Russia but the solution to the conflict would be to accord the region maximum autonomy within Russia borders
There is no doubt that Chechnya according to OSCE principles belongs to a state called Russia he said pointing out that Russia was an OSCE member and it was not the organisation policy to challenge members sovereignty
He added that the OSCE was the only international body which has been allowed into the Chechnya to monitor the human rights situation there but that its means were restricted by the fact that the conflict was a internal issue
We have a small concept the details of which have yet to be worked out
Chechnya must be accorded the maximum autonomy possible within the framework of Russian integrity said Cotti
Dutch say no reason to reopen El Al carqo enquiry
THE HAGUE
The Dutch transport minister Annemarie Jorritsma told the country second chamber that there is no further need to investigate the 1992 crash of an El Al freighter which left 43 dead in an Amsterdam suburb
She said that a request from her ministry for the aircraft waybill documentation and further information about the contents of its hold had been complied with by El Al head office in Tel Aviv
The Dutch transport ministry had come in for pressure from a of Dutch members of parliaments in May this year some of whom believed the aircraft had been carrying unlisted dangerous goods
Others said they thought the aircraft was loaded with too much airfreight
Jorritsma said the latest evidence from El Al in no way supported the allegations and added there is no justification for a further investigation into the incident

Armenians Azeris hold peace talks in Germany
BONN
Representatives from Armenia and Azerbaijan held talks earlier this week in Germany on bringing a lasting peace to the disputed region a diplomatic source close to the talks said on Friday
The source who spoke on condition of anonymity said Azerbaijani presidential adviser Vafa Gulizade and his Armenian counterpart Zhirayr Liparityan met to discuss the disputed enclave on Wednesday and had now flown home
An uneasy ceasefire has prevailed in which represents around 20 percent of Azeri territory since May 1994 after ethnic Armenians drove Azeris out of the region
The conflict which began in 1988 claimed over lives
The main subject of the talks was the search for a peaceful solution for the source said
He declined to reveal any more details about the content of the talks or their exact location in Germany
Azerbaijan has said it is prepared to grant autonomy to if Armenian forces pull out but will not accept Armenia demands for the independence of the enclave
Russia Interfax news agency reported on Tuesday the officials had departed for negotiations in Germany adding that talks between the two sides first took place last December in Amsterdam
Interfax said the discussions were being held in parallel with peace talks mediated by the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe OSCE and the Minsk Group of countries led by Russia and Finland
Sombre mood on Arctic island after plane crash
Rolf Soderlind
LONGYEAR Norway
The windblown chilly streets of this tiny Arctic town are all but deserted and flags are flying at beneath a brooding clouded sky
Longyear is a town in mourning a community that has been shattered
Disaster struck on Thursday when a Russian airliner bringing coal miners to work crashed as it came in to land at the airport killing all 141 people on board
It a sight I will never forget
I will remember it for the rest of my life said Stig Onarheim
He was one of a handful of rescuers who raced to the scene of the crash in a helicopter on Thursday hoping in vain to find survivors
The plane smashed into a mountain on the Arctic island of Spitzbergen on Thursday just east of Longyear
Imagine a big plane with a lot of luggage and people on board
Think of all that mixed together with twisted wrecked parts on the slope Onarheim 29 told Reuters
Police and local officials have sealed off the crash site protecting it from intrusive reporters and from the polar bears that roam freely across the icy expanses
The dead were all Russians and Ukrainians coming to work in the mining towns of Barentsburg and Pyramiden
Longyear is a Norwegian settlement of just over people but it also feels the loss keenly
I have trouble finding the words to express my grief
It a tragedy for everyone
We know many of the people who live in Barentsburg some of them could have been on the plane said Johan Sletten 52
Sletten a caretaker who has lived on the island for 30 years said the Norwegian and Russian communities visit frequently competing at soccer in the summer and with races in the winter
Teenage shop assistant Heidi Groenstein was blunter
I glad it was not a Norwegian plane she said
Just think of it a mining village where so many workers die
They must be having a tough time of it now
Barentsburg just a few hours ride by or 15 minutes by helicopter from Longyear has asked to be left alone with its grief and told reporters to stay away
Around 100 Russian and Ukrainian miners were waiting in Longyear to fly home on the plane that crashed
They were given shelter in the town church overnight and ate a sombre breakfast before getting on a bus for the airport
Another plane had been sent from Moscow to pick them up
At this time of year the only colour in Longyear comes from the wooden houses
Everything else is muddy the waters of the fjord leaden
Winter is in the air
Barentsburg is an even grimmer place a testament to the hardships of the new Russia
Spitzbergen lies some 500 miles 800 km off the northern tip of Norway and endures one of the most extreme climates on the planet
Inhabited by fewer than people in total it sees the sun for 24 hours a day during summer and is plunged into darkness in the winter months
The terrain is mountainous the only roads are dirt tracks
Norway rules the island group under the terms of a 1920s international treaty which gave many other nations the right to establish setttlements and exploit the coal that is still mined there
Only Russia has chosen to do so

HK has infrastructure in place for Tsang
AUCKLAND
Hong Kong Financial Secretary Donald Tsang said on Friday that the territory had the infrastructural hardware to make a success of its future under Chinese sovereignty from
We have the largest and most efficient port on the South China coast we have the best transport and telecommunications infrastructure in the world and we are investing in this hardware on an enormous scale Tsang said in a speech to Auckland during a visit to New Zealand
Hong Kong also had the necessary constitutional infrastructure in place with the promise of autonomy in running its affairs after the handover from Britain to China
What this means in practice is that Hong Kong will go on raising its own taxes issuing its own currency setting its own expenditure priorities and managing its own enormous financial reserves Tsang said
He acknowledged that many Hong Kong people had decided to seek their future elsewhere and others were sure to follow in the next nine months
But for the great majority of us Hong Kong is our home and Hong Kong future is our future

Arafat goes to Nablus ahead of cabinet meeting
NABLUS West Bank
Palestinian President Yasser Arafat arrived in the West Bank enclave of Nablus from Ramallah on Friday witnesses said
His aides said Arafat would hold the weekly meeting of the Palestinian Authority cabinet in Nablus on Saturday
In Jerusalem Israeli security forces were bracing for thousands of Palestinians expected to answer Arafat call earlier this week to come to the city holy to Moslems Arabs and Jews to pray in protest against Israel settlement policy in the West Bank and delay in peace negotiations
Palestinians want Arab East Jerusalem as the capital of a future independent state
Israel which captured and annexed East Jerusalem in 1967 says it will never cede any part of the city
Arafat who made an interim peace deal with Israel in 1993 that set up says he will only visit Jerusalem once Israeli occupation has ended
Council concerned about Israeli bulldozers
UNITED NATIONS
Security Council members expressed concern on Thursday that Israel bulldozing of a Palestinian centre for the disabled might further injure the Middle East peace process
Responding to a letter from the the Palestinian observer mission Security Council President Tono Eitel of Germany said that members asked him to convey their views to Israel charge David Peleg
The members expressed their concern about the maintenance of the peace process and they urged that no action be taken that would have a negative impact on the negotiations Eitel said after an informal council session
They asked me to call in the Israeli charge and discuss the matter with him he added
The Palestinian letter from Marwan Jilani said the destruction of the Jerusalem centre was an effort by Israel to alter the character demographic composition and status of the Holy City of Jerusalem and violated agreements between Israel and the Palestinian Liberation Organisation
This most recent measure represents a revival of old malicious plans to confiscate the land and build units for Israeli settlers within the walls of the Old City
We expect the international community to take a clear and firm position based on international law and in accordance with resolutions against all such Israeli violations and illegal practices he said
On Tuesday Israeli crews hoisted a bulldozer over the walls of Jerusalem old city and demolished the centre saying it was being restored without a building permit
Canada had recently donated 30 million to the centre called the Burj Society
SOCCER REAL SCRAPE DRAW IN SCRAPPY OPENING MATCH
LA CORUNA Spain
A late goal by defender Roberto Carlos saved the blushes of Real Madrid coach Fabio Capello and his peseta in the opening game of the Spanish championship on Saturday
The Brazilian effort was enough to earn Real a point from a scrappy draw at fellow title contenders Deportivo Coruna
Deportivo started strongly taking the lead midway through the first half when former Auxerre playmaker Corentine Martins headed home a corner after a by Spanish international midfielder Donato
Real looked to be in deep trouble shortly after the break when Luis Milla was sent off for committing two bookable offences in as many minutes
But Deportivo were unable to capitalise on their numerical advantage and were themselves reduced to ten men when Armando Alvarez was sent off 15 minutes from time
Shortly afterwards Roberto Carlos found space in the home defence and equalised for Real with a shot that was deflected past despairing Deportivo keeper Jacques
In a frantic final five minutes there were chances at both ends and Donato who had earlier been booked was sent off for protesting about the incursion of Real players at a free kick
Before the match Deportivo chairman Augusto Lendoiro said he would ignore a FIFA decision banning Brazilian midfielder Mauro Silva from playing in the match for failing to join his national side tour of Europe
In the event coach John Toshack decided not to use Silva who had claimed he did not join the Brazil squad because he had lost his passport

RUGBY UNION LYNAGH SEALS VICTORY OVER DWYER AND LEICESTER
LONDON
Former Wallaby captain Michael Lynagh began his career in English club rugby in impeccable fashion on Saturday to frustrate his old coach Bob Dwyer on his league coaching debut with Leicester
Lynagh kicked five penalties and a conversion from his six attempts at goal to steer his Saracens side to a home win and offer millionaire backer Nigel Wray an early return on his big investment in the north London club
French centre Philippe Sella also enjoyed a good game alongside Lynagh although the home team scored only one try through England Kyran Bracken
The new French connection at Harlequins also made a good start Laurent Cabannes and Laurent Benezech scoring a try apiece in their side victory over Gloucester
Former England captain Will Carling handed the kicking duties finished with 20 points
With the first day of the league season briefly shifting the spotlight away from the discord between the clubs and the Rugby Football Union there were also emphatic victories for champions Bath winners over Orrell and Northampton and narrow successes for Wasps and Bristol

RUGBY UNION SPRINGBOKS FINALLY BREAK ALL BLACK SPELL
Andy Colquhoun
JOHANNESBURG
South Africa managed to avoid a fifth successive defeat in 1996 at the hands of the All Blacks with an emphatic victory in front of an ecstatic Ellis Park crowd on Saturday
They scored three tries in recording their highest total against New Zealand salvaging some pride in a season in which the world champions have lost five out of eight tests
It also ended a run of nine successive victories this year for New Zealand but arrived too late to prevent a series defeat and an historic first All Black series triumph on South African soil
Springbok Joost van der Westhuizen was his side inspiration scoring their opening try and making the third for flanker Andre Venter from a quickly taken penalty to give his side a lead after 54 minutes
Fullback Andre Joubert scored the other scorching in from 40 metres at the start of the second half to add to his three penalties
The All Blacks salvaged some pride by scoring two tries from centre Walter Little and Justin Marshall in the final five minutes to close a gap which at one point stood at 24 points
But they generally endured an highlighted by recalled Andrew Mehrtens who missed five out of eight kicks at goal
Recalled Henry Honiball kicked the Springboks into a lead after 10 minutes only to see Andrew Mehrtens launch a penalty from eight metres inside his own half to narrow the gap
Mehrtens missed three further penalties and a conversion in the first 40 minutes which could have put his side ahead but it was the Springboks who looked the more dangerous
Their promise was realised when Joubert made a break in the 25th minute and although winger Pieter Hendriks appeared to knock on Joubert reverse pass Welsh referee Derek Bevan allowed Van der Westhuizen to pick up and score under the posts
Honiball converted and Joubert kicked a penalty before All Black hooker Sean Fitzpatrick scored a try from close range on the stroke of to narrow the lead to and hint at a comeback
Instead Joubert kicked another long penalty and then raced around the outside of the defence to score the Springboks second try
A quick penalty from Van der Westhuizen five metres from the All Black line set up the third try for Venter five minutes later and when Joubert kicked his third penalty the Springboks held an unassailable lead going into the last quarter
When the All Blacks did break through it was too late
Centre Walter Little followed up Mehrtens kick to score under the posts and Justin Marshall forced himself over from a ruck close to the line in to give them some consolation

SQUASH HILL BRANDS WORLD CHAMPION JANSHER A CHEAT
HONG KONG
Controversial Australian Anthony Hill called Jansher Khan a cheat during his acrimonious defeat by the world number one in the Hong Kong Open semifinals on Saturday
The match boiled over when Hill made to walk off court after what he claimed was a point in the third
When the referee called Jansher return good and the decision was accepted by the player Hill shrieked at the Pakistani You cheat
He was standing right there and knew the shot was down so I called him a cheat said Hill whose squash career has been blighted by fines and suspensions for unacceptable behaviour
He knew it was down and accepted what I called him because of that
Hill won the game on the next point and said later that Jansher was generally honest on court but played by the referee decision
The Australian had upset Jansher rhythm with his mixture of gamesmanship and fluent but eventually succumbed
I changed my strategy against him today and had him rattled he added
He is not as fit as he used to be be but was too good for me in the end
I shook him a bit but he will come out next time and be a better player for it that Jansher
Jansher said that he was disturbed to be called a cheat
What he did was bad for squash bad for the crowd and bad for the sponsors
We are trying to build up squash like tennis and players should not say things like that
I think the Professional Squash Association should look into this matter and deal with it properly
I am not calling for him to be banned but they have to take some action
Jansher bidding for an eighth Hong Kong Open title plays Australian Rodney Eyles in the final
Eyles played his best squash of the tournament to beat Peter Nicol of Scotland
Eyles who defeated Jansher in the semifinals of the Portuguese Open in 1993 said that he would like to win for the good of the game
I have nothing against Jansher but it will be great if I could beat him said Eyles
My biggest problem against Jansher is concentration
I want to beat him so badly that I just cannot get it together

GOLF PARNEVIK TAKES LEAD AT GREATER MILWAUKEE OPEN
MILWAUKEE Wisconsin
Jesper Parnevik of Sweden fired a course 63 Saturday to take a lead into the final round of the million Greater Milwaukee Open
Parnevik who is seeking his first PGA Tour victory moved to 194 for the tournament
Parnevik tied the record set by Loren Roberts in 1994 at the Brown Deer Park Golf Course and also equalled Saturday by Greg Kraft
Nolan Henke who led by two strokes entering the third round carded a 67 and was one stroke back at 195
He is striving for his fourth career PGA Tour victory and first since the 1993 BellSouth Classic
Tiger Woods who made the cut in his first tournament as a professional shot a 73 and was four under for the tournament
The Woods who turned professional Tuesday after winning an unprecedented third successive Amateur Championship struggled on the front nine bogeying the first and seventh holes and the ninth hole
After bogeying the 10th hole to move to for the round he rallied for birdies on 15 and 18
After Parnevik started off his round by parring the first hole and bogeying the second the Swede birdied six of the next seven holes
Parnevik continued to storm through the course birdying three holes on the back nine including two from 12 feet out on the 15th and 17th holes
I ca remember when I putted this well said Parnevik
I was disappointed when a did go in
My game feels very good
I been fading my driver but today whenever I set up for a fade it went straight
Whenever everyone making birdies you never want to be even par
Henke had a round and birdied four holes including a on the seventh hole and one from 12 feet out on the 12th hole
I did hit it very well today said Henke
Jasper blew right by me
Once he did I knew I had to make birdies just to keep up
I made some really good pars
I basically picked up where I left off yesterday afternoon
Right now I ca put my finger on what wrong
Bob Estes shot a 67 for sole possession of third place at
Steve Stricker who tied for second at last week World Series of Golf and Stuart Appleby were both five shots off the lead at 14 under
Duffy Waldorf who also tied for second at the World Series of Golf carded a 70 to lead a group of six golfers at 13 under including Kraft
The top four on the PGA Tour money list all skipped the tournament
TENNIS SPAIN TEAMS OPEN ON ROAD FOR 1997 FED CUP
Richard Finn
NEW YORK
This year Fed Cup finalists defending champion Spain and the United States will hit the road to open the 1997 women international team competition based on the draw conducted Saturday at the Open
Spain travels to Belgium while the team heads to the Netherlands for matches March
The other two ties will pit hosts Germany against the Czech Republic and visiting France against Japan
The semifinals are July and the final September 28
Life on the road this year did not slow the Americans who will try to avenge their defeat in the final last year when they host Spain on September in Atlantic City
Last year we stood on the court after we had lost and we put out hands together and made it our committment to bring back the Cup captain Billie Jean King said at the draw
That is our sole goal
The United States edged Austria in Salzburg in the opening round in April and then blanked Japan in Nagoya last month in the semifinals
The victory against Japan marked the Fed Cup debut of Monica Seles who became a naturalised citizen in 1994
Seles easily won both her singles matches and King is counting on the number one to lead the team again
I told Monica we need her if we want to win King said
Seles sore left shoulder and a wrist injury to Fed Cup veteran Mary Joe Fernandez have forced King to take a wait and see attitude regarding her squad for the match
Fernandez was forced to withdraw from the Open
We will wait until the last minute so we check with everybody and their injuries said King
What we like would be Seles Olympic champion Lindsay Davenport and Mary Joe Fernandez
If she can get that threesome together King will feel good about her chances against the Spain formidable duo of Arantxa Sanchez Vicario and Conchita Martinez
To be a great coach you have to have the right horses and I got the right horses said King

TENNIS EDBERG REFUSES TO QO QUIETLY
Richard Finn
NEW YORK
Refusing to go quietly in the night Stefan Edberg extended his stay at his 14th and last Open when Bernd Karbacher trailing and hurting quit in the fourth set of their match Friday
The Edberg a former Open champion had wrestled control of the match away from Karbacher when the German hampered by a left hamstring injury decided he could continue under the stadium lights at the National Tennis Centre
A win is a win
I take it Edberg who has announced that this will be his last Grand Slam event said of the victory
Ironically Karbacher two years ago ended Ivan Lendl Grand Slam career here when the former champion had to retire in the middle of their match
After seeing the trainer come out early in the third set Edberg was not surprised by Karbacher decision not to go on
I knew he had problems with something Edberg said
I really was surprised
Edberg had his own problems early in the match as the Swede battled to acclimate himself to the nighttime conditions while Karbacher was ripping passing shots and blasting serves past him
I did really feel good to begin with I had problems finding the timing on the ball seeing the ball said Edberg who upset Wimbledon champion and Richard Krajicek in the first round
This was one of these matches where I did play up to my standard
I had to fight hard
Edberg tenacity paid off in the second set
Edberg lost his own serve twice but he rallied for three breaks of his own the last to wrap up the set
That where the match sort of changed said Edberg
I think once I got that second set I felt a lot better about my game
Edberg is starting to feel pretty good about postponing his swan song a lot longer
It does look all that bad Edberg said of his path through the draw starting next with a match against Krajicek Dutch countryman Paul Haarhuis
However the 1991 and 1992 champion is not ready to start making plans to be in next week final
I always being realistic said Edberg
Like I said many times I think it a very little chance but nothing is impossible
If I play great tennis that could take me a long way
A lot of things can happen like tonight

Steve Pagani
VIENNA
Austria dominated their World Cup group four qualifier against Scotland on Saturday with wave after wave of attacks but were unable to penetrate the visitors defence and had to settle for a goalless draw
Scotland who thrashed Belarus in their opening group four match were unable to repeat their performance
Austria best chance came in the 63rd minute with Stephan Marasek of SC Freiburg taking advantage of a scramble in the Scottish penalty area but his shot narrowly passing the post
They also went close a minute before the interval when a promising attack saw the ball fall to Markus Schopp but he hit his shot wide
Everton Duncan Ferguson went close for Scotland in the 65th minute when he forced Austrian goalkeeper Michael Konsel to a diving save
Two Scotland players were shown yellow cards captain Gary McAllister for bringing down Andreas Heraf and Ferguson for arguing against the referee decision
The result is acceptable Scottish coach Craig Brown told reporters
We hoped not to lose and we tried not to play for a draw but the Austrian defence was simply too good
SK Rapid Dietmar Kuehbauer who gave an impressive performance said the team started off well but let the game slip after the first 30 minutes
Somehow it seemed there were less than 11 players on the pitch
We have lost two points
The Scots are not really a great team and we should have won he said
Austrian coach Herbert Prohaska said his team had displayed great fighting spirit but sometimes lacked ideas

SOCCER FRANCE LAUNCH 1998 WORLD CUP WITH WIN
PARIS
Euro 96 absentee Nicolas Ouedec and Youri Djorkaeff scored the goals as 1998 World Cup hosts France beat Mexico in a friendly international on Saturday
The victory extended to 29 matches France unbeaten run under coach Aime Jacquet their Euro 96 semifinal elimination having come in a penalty but was marred by the of Chelsea central defender Franck Leboeuf
Leboeuf was dismissed two minutes from time for a second bookable offence fouling Mexican substitute Ricardo Pelaez who minutes earlier had also been shown the yellow card for pushing the Chelsea defender in the back
Both goals came early in the second half after France had surprised the Mexicans with three substitutions
After a sterile first half France injected more sting in midfield with the introduction of Juventus Zinedine Zidane
This allowed Djorkaeff to play further up and his cross from the right fell for Ouedec who has joined Espanyol of Barcelona from Nantes since missing the European championship finals through injury to score after a mistake by midfielder Joaquin del Olmo
Within four minutes Ouedec was returning the compliment for Djorkaeff playing a with the Internazionale Milan forward down the middle to set him up for a cross shot past diving goalkeeper Osvaldo Sanchez

SOCCER BELGIUM SCRAPE PAST TURKEY DESPITE CROWD TROUBLE
Bert Lauwers
BRUSSELS
Belgium kicked off their 1998 World Cup campaign with a victory over Turkey in a tense match marred by Turkish crowd trouble shortly after the break
Turkish fans upset at their team deficit ripped apart dozens of plastic seats and threw them over the fence
Riot police took 10 minutes to restore order
The police were given an unexpected hand by substitute Sergen Yalcin who rekindled Turkish hopes in the 61st with a splendid which stunned Belgian goalkeeper Filip De Wilde
But Yalcin who had come on just four minutes earlier turned from hero to villain barely two minutes after his strike when he was sent off after spitting at an opponent and arguing with English referee David Elleray
Marc Degryse had opened the scoring for Belgium after 13 minutes whacking a low drive into the net after an incisive pass by defender Dirk Medved from the edge of the penalty area
Luis Oliveira then gleefully slipped the ball past goalkeeper Rustu Recber from the right of the area to make it seven minutes before the interval Turkey best effort proving to be a vicious shot by Ogun Temizkanoglu which De Wilde tipped over
The visitors seeking to restore some pride after failing to score a single goal in Euro 96 in June repeatedly ripped through the left side of the home defence but De Wilde was able to block several efforts
With only the group seven winners qualifying automatically for the 1998 finals in France Belgium could not afford a at home and they frantically chased a decisive third goal
But they were almost upset 12 minutes from time when De Wilde fumbled a hard Arif Erdem shot and Orhan Cikirikci almost pounced on the loose ball
Belgium best effort came three minutes later when Degryse put the ball over the bar from close range with Recber beaten

Paper says Thatcher office consulted astrologer
LONDON
A British newspaper said Margaret Thatcher was so shaken by an IRA attempt on her life when she was prime minister in 1984 that an astrologer was asked to warn her against future threats
The Sunday Telegraph quoted Majorie Orr as saying she did a horoscope chart for Thatcher a Libran after she narrowly escaped death in the Irish guerrilla bombing of a hotel during the Conservative Party conference more than a decade ago
Orr said Thatcher press secretary Bernard Ingram asked her to telephone if she saw any threatening indications in the future
Bernard Ingham told me that if I ever heard anything that indicated danger I was to let him know Orr said
Orr said she never had to telephone
She added that the horoscope was purely for security purposes and she was never consulted about political moves
Ingram was quoted as telling the newspaper he thought astrology was a load of rubbish and that he could not recall asking Orr to keep a watch on Thatcher stars
Thatcher dubbed the Iron Lady for her driven forceful personality was never known to have an interest in the occult and in fact has a university degree in chemistry
Former president Ronald Reagan wife Nancy admitted in her biography My Turn that she regularly consulted an astrologer to help her plan her husband schedule

The Rally for the Return of Refugees and Democracy in Rwanda RDR urged the High Commissioner for Refugees to avoid any policing approach and to calm refugees by explaining the aims of the operation
The RDR appeals to all refugees to prepare themselves calmly for the demands of the census agents because it will be in their ultimate interest the group said in a statement
It said refugees feared census takers would use indelible ink to mark them so they could be detected by Rwandan government troops and mistreated if they were forced back into Rwanda
officials said more than aid workers will take part in the census from Sunday until Tuesday of the estimated refugees in camps around the eastern Zairean border town of Goma
Only about 100 refugees a week are returning voluntarily to Rwanda in contrast to the 600 babies born in the camps weekly
Zairean Prime Minister Kengo wa Dondo said at the end of a visit to Rwanda last week that the Zairean and Rwandan governments agreed on an organised massive and unconditional repatriation of the million Rwandan refugees in Zaire
He said the repatriation would be carried out swiftly and would be enormous starting with the closure of refugee camps
RDR said it feared forced expulsions would start in days
Zairean troops expelled refugees in August last year

More than a thousand women children and men gathered in a field to the north of the town of on Saturday to wait for a column of rebels to withdraw from the capital Grozny about 25 km 12 miles away
The men fired weapons into the air as groups of women danced
Adults in the crowd carried posters of former Chechen leader Dzhokhar Dudayev who declared independence in 1991 and children carrying photographs of him called Troops out
Russian military officials have expressed fears that the rebels and their supporters will see the deal signed by Russian peace envoy Alexander Lebed in the early hours of Saturday as a military victory for the separatists
It involves the withdrawal of Russian troops sent to Chechnya in December 1994 to crush the separatists and a postponement of the issue at the heart of the conflict the status of the North Caucasus region
But the people in the crowd on Saturday who had turned out in support of the rebels did not seem sure that the war was over
We hope for the best that it really has ended so we can live in peace
It our only dream said a woman Mubatik Dagayeva
Aiza Dudayeva with her son beside her shared the guarded optimism
We really want the war to end we hope and believe that our sons and brothers will win said Dudayeva adding that she was from

But on Saturday the people gathered just outside the town seemed to be united in favour of the separatists
Two columns of rebels appeared in jeeps and cars firing their guns in the air as the crowd rushed towards them
Mouldi Mamatuyev in his late 20 dressed in black and carrying a machine gun was welcomed by his mother and sister
Two sons have come back said his mother Nurbika Mamatuyeva
It the end
We believe in God
Mamatuyev joked that his sister Lisa was a rebel too and she responded by grabbing hold of his gun and shouting the Chechen war cry Allahu Akhbar God is Greatest and Freedom for Chechnya
The fighter sitting next to a man dressed in green and carrying a said that the strict Islamic law adopted by the rebels during the conflict was now needed to impose peace
The war has ended if everything works out if there is law there will be power
Only Sheriat Islamic law can end the war

A consortium of press distributor Hachette and Polish publishers group UWP are seeking more than than 50 percent of Ruch and French President Jacques Chirac is likely to support its case when he visits Poland in September the daily said
chain Ruch which controls about 65 percent of Poland press distribution market had a net profit of million zlotys on sales of billion zlotys in 1995
It has about and was the country sole press distributor before the 1989 fall of communism
Zycie Warszawy said the new open consortium which also included several listed Polish firms would on Monday inform Privatisation Minister Wieslaw Kaczmarek of its plans
It aims to invest 200 million in Ruch over five years more than the sum Ruch says it needs to upgrade its outlets
Initially Poland offered up to 75 percent of Ruch but in March Kaczmarek cancelled the tender and offered a minority stake with an option to increase the equity
Two consortia and a consortium of a Polish SPC group and Swiss firms placed initial bids
But after the change of tender conditions Swiss investors pulled out and SPC decided to bid jointly with
Kaczmarek said in May he was unhappy that only one investor ended up bidding for Ruch in which the government was initially offering up to 35 percent of shares with an option to extend the holding after investment promises are fulfilled

China said to fear dissidents more than criminals
MANILA
The detention of veteran dissident Wang Donghai showed China determination to crush any vestige of dissent during the current profound transitions in the nation leadership a human rights activist said on Saturday
Xiao Qiang executive director of the New group Human Rights in China said Wang arrest on Friday appeared to be part of the national Strike Hard campaign that has imprisoned thousands and sent hundreds to their death
Although supposedly aimed at criminals dozens of human rights activists have been detained in the campaign which is meant to strengthen the Communist Party grip on power as senior leader Deng Xiaoping nears death Xiao said in an interview
China is going through this power transition period
The authorities are apparently extremely afraid of any political and social discontent said Xiao in Manila to attend an Amnesty International conference on human rights in China
He said one of Wang apparent offences was to write a public letter in May suggesting that a free press and an independent judicial system were vital if the government really meant to stamp out rampant corruption
Xiao said crushing legitimate dissent was only making the problem worse and one day China would pay a high price
Those issues are not going to go away by repression
You only make things more hidden but potentially more explosive he said
Wang was arrested in the east China city of Hangzhou by security officers who told the dissident family he would be sent to a study class a euphemism for coercive ideological reform
Wang 45 was sentenced last month to one year by labour but was released because of
Xiao said conditions in the labour camp were so brutal they drove another activist sentenced with Wang to attempt suicide
Police beat Wang and his colleague Chen Longde and encouraged other camp inmates to attack them as well Xiao said

Burma Suu Kyi says military rulers abuse law
Deborah Charles
RANGOON
Burma democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi hit out at the government on Saturday for recent arrests and jailing of activists saying the military abused the law to try to crush the democracy movement
The main purpose of this press conference is to make it known to the world that the authorities are misusing the law all the time in order to try to crush the democracy movement Suu Kyi told reporters at her Rangoon home
Suu Kyi said at least 61 democracy supporters had been arrested since May and about 30 of them had been sentenced most to long prison terms
In May the government launched a sweeping crackdown on the democracy movement detaining over 260 members of Suu Kyi National League for Democracy NLD ahead of a party congress
Most were released but several dozen remain in custody
The Burmese government last week confirmed the recent sentencing of nine democracy activists who were arrested in the May crackdown including Suu Kyi assistant Win Htein
The military government which in May said it had detained the politicians to prevent anarchy said the activists were charged with attempting to destroy the peace and stability of the state
But Suu Kyi disagreed with the methods saying officials often arrested NLD supporters in the middle of the night then did not give them the opportunity to defend themselves in trials
When our people are tried they are tried in a very secretive way
Their families are not told she said
Suu Kyi who spearheads a campaign for sanctions on Burma government was under house arrest for six years without being tried before being released in July 1995
Several other leading members of the NLD have served prison terms
The NLD party won a landslide victory in a 1990 election but the State Law and Order Restoration Council SLORC which assumed power in 1988 after crushing demonstrations never recognised the poll
This lack of rule of law is an indication that the authorities are not interested in fair play she said
They are using a travesty of the law to try and crush our movements and to sentence our people to long terms in prison without proper trial
Suu Kyi said once the activists were sentenced they suffered inhuman conditions and lack of rights in prison
Almost all of the prisoners start suffering from various health problems after a couple of years in jail she said
Some of our people have been in prison for five to six years
Most political prisoners are held in Rangoon Insein Prison
Some who have been released have recounted torture methods like sleep and food deprivation and physical abuse
If there are any more instances of death in custody it will be further proof that a prison sentence for political prisoners is sometimes almost the same as a death sentence Suu Kyi said
Hla Than an elected member of parliament for the NLD died in early August after being at Insein for six years
His death came five weeks after James Leander Leo Nichols a close friend of Suu Kyi and Danish honorary consul died while serving a prison term at Insein
Suu Kyi said the government had increased its repression tactics on the democracy movement because it feared the growing popularity of the movement
But she said she and the NLD would not stop their efforts to bring democracy to Burma even if it meant more arrests of party members or even herself
We will carry on
Nobody is free from arrest in Burma

Automakers agency plan air bag safety ads
DETROIT
Automakers suppliers insurers and the federal government auto safety agency Saturday launched a 10 million safety awareness campaign aimed at reducing the number of children killed accidentally by air bags in cars and trucks
Officials said they will work with law enforcement agencies pediatricians and media to warn parents about the dangers that air bags pose to children and adults not wearing seatbelts
Since 1993 24 children have been killed by the explosive force of automotive air bags which inflate at speeds up to 200 miles per hour
The first portion of the campaign involves pickup trucks equipped with billboards that were driving along some of the nation busiest interstate highways during the Labor Day weekend including Interstate 95 on the East Coast Interstates 80 and 90 in the Midwest and Interstate 5 in California
The boards read Air Bag Safety Everyone Buckled Kids in Back
Janet Dewey executive director of the National Automobile Occupant Protection Campaign said most of the injuries to children occurred because they were not wearing seatbelts
A child chances of being killed in a car accident whether the vehicle was equipped with an air bag or not is reduced by 29 percent when they are in the rear seat she said
The auto industry was about three to six years away from introducing smart air bags with the ability to detect the size and position of an occupant and adjust inflation pressures accordingly
Current air bags were designed to halt the forward momentum of an unbelted adult male not a small child
Automakers petitioned the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to allow them to introduce air bags that inflate less aggressively to help reduce unwanted injuries
Even if changes are made to airbags today we still have 20 million vehicles on the road with current technology Dewey said
The public has been getting the message

We have taken those prudent planning steps
Clinton said on Saturday he had ordered forces in the Gulf to go on high alert and was reinforcing them in response to Iraqi attacks on Kurdish dissidents in northern Iraq
These developments cause me grave concern Clinton said at a campaign stop in Troy Tennessee
But he added It is premature at this time and I want to emphasize that highly premature to speculate on any response we might have
The defense officials said military flights to enforce zones in both northern and southern Iraq doubled over the weekend
Clinton said Iraqi military forces overran the city of Arbil which has been held since 1994 by Kurdish rebels who Baghdad says are backed by Iran

Controversial IRA film screened at Venice festival
Vera Haller
VENICE Italy
director Neil Jordan says he never lost more sleep over a film than over Michael Collins his controversial epic about the IRA which has its premiere on Saturday at the Venice Film Festival
The film starring Liam Neeson and Julia Roberts recounts the life of Michael Collins the Irish Republican Army Director of Intelligence who fought for Irish independence from 1919 to 1921
Although not due for release in Britain until early next year some politicians have already said they feared it would fan sectarian tensions in Northern Ireland
Jordan defends his decision to make the film whose screenplay he wrote himself after years of research saying it was more about history than any political statement
The film spares neither the Irish nor the British in its depiction of the savagery of the time Jordan said in a statement released by Warner Bros
How often has independence been achieved without bloodshed
Very rarely
Jordan whose 1992 film The Crying Game also came under fire for what was perceived as a sympathetic portrayal of the IRA said Collins was more than just a revolutionary
He developed techniques of guerilla warfare later copied by independence movements around the world from Mao in China to Yitzak Shamir in Israel Jordan said
Collins would never be a proponent of contemporary terrorism as practised today
He was a soldier and a statesman and over time a man of peace
Leeson the Northern actor who was nominated for an Oscar for best actor for his performance in Schindler List plays the lead role in Jordan film
Aidan Quinn portrays Harry Boland Collins best friend and rival for the love of Kitty Kiernan played by Roberts
Much of the film was shot on location in Dublin with Jordan using thousands of its citizens as unpaid extras
A set however was used for the fighting scenes
Noting that information about Collins was as mysterious as the existence he maintained Jordan said he made some historical assumptions in the film
I have made choices about certain events based on my own extensive research into his letters and reported speeches he said
I wanted to make this a story as accurate as possible without killing it dramatically and I think I have
It is a very true film
One of the assumptions is his interpretation of the murky circumstances surrounding the shooting death of Collins who had broken with his comrades when he sought a negotiated settlement with Britain in an ambush in 1922
I have never lost more sleep over the making of a film than I have over Michael Collins but I never make a more important one Jordan said
In the life of one person you can tell the events that formed the north and south of Ireland as they are today
