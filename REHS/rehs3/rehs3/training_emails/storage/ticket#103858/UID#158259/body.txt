[Ticket created from XUP by bhaddad1]
[From: Bassam Haddad]
[System: Oasis]
[Category: Accounts]
I have run some simulations recently, and the output (only a few GB so far) was to:

/oasis/scratch/comet/bhaddad1/temp_project/Cx50_Ace_2.0_dmpcwNaCl_OUT/

however, I do not see my Oasis usage in the account overview changing, and I want to make sure I am using the proper storage system. Could you please help me?
