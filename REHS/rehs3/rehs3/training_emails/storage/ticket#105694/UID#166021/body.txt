Hi, I cannot login to oasis/comet recently as I used to. My local user name for oasis/comet was bowang. 

I don't know if it is related to the project renewal. But my allocation manager told me he has already added me the access to oasis/comet. 

It's really appreciated if you can help as I have quite a lot of data stored in oasis. Thanks!
