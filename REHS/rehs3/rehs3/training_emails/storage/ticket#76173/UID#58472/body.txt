I need to bring in some previously calculated data-sets from my University server's (rit1.las.iastate.edu) to comet. When I do:

scp XXXX@rit1.las.iastate.edu:/path/to/files .

I get the following error:

"ssh: Could not resolve hostname rit1.las.iastate.edu: Name or service not known"

I've tried multiple time with different server's, but I get the same error every time. Can you please suggest how should I proceed? At the moment, I've about 70 files about 900 GB in total. Once I copy them, I need to merge them resulting a single large file of about 150-200 GB and then I can delete these 70 files.
