[Category: Allocations]
Although I have 400 gb of data in my oasis/projects/nsf/csd517/binman folder, my user portal does not show any usage data on oasis.  Is there any way to determine how much of my storage allocation I've used, other than du of my different folders?

Do things stored in both oasis/projects/nsf/csd517/binman and oasis/scratch/comet/binman count toward my allocation?
