Hello all,

the user-guide (https://portal.xsede.org/sdsc-comet) does not mention anything to that effect but I'd rather err on the side of caution: on comet, is data on /oasis/scratch/comet/$USER/temp_project/ subject to being deleted if not accessed for a certain amount of time or do files stored there persist until I manually delete them?

Somewhat related: is there larger (and slower) storage where I could "park" files that I currently do not use and that are large enough that they push my disk usage too close to my quota (10TB?) to be comfortable.

Yours,
Roland
