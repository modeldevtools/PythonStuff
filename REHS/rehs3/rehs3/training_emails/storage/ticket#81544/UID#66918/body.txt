Hello, 

I am using my system to run a program on large files. The large files are up to 100GB and is located on a different server that is not my local machine. Can you recommend a method to transfer these large files from my server to my XSEDE system?

Additionally, is there a way to check how much disk space I available for my system?

Thank you,

Danny
