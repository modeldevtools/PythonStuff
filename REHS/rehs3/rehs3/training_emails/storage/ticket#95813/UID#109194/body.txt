Hi,


I have been approved the start up usage of SCSD and just had a few questions that might help me run it smoothly and efficiently. I adapted the parallel code created by my student while he was using a trial version a while ago (screenshot attached), but some details I am not sure about.

1) since I got the new account, I am not sure what to put in line 18;

2) for the same reason, I am not sure if I need a new keyfile or how to find it;

I went through the tutorials and my overall understanding is that the input files and the code has to be both in my Comet account home folder and local folder on my computer. Following that, I guess I should just configure the parallel.m script (below) and run it from my computer. 

In the tutorial I saw that the computationally intensive jobs should not be run in the log in folder (not sure if that's the home folder), so I just wanted to clarify that. Currently I would just like to optimize this code to get the best usage of cluster, so I might try different versions.

Thanks so much for your input.
