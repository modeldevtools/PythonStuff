Hi,

I currently have my data stored in 

oasis/scratch/comet/jspal002/temp_project

and I am concerned about whether there is any risk my data might be deleted. This concern was raised by a colleague who said that data stored in "scratch" gets deleted every 90 days.

I have not encountered this problem, however I'd like to know if I should be moving my data over to my home directory.

Best wishes,

Jon
