Hi

I have a research startup allocation  approved in January, and the storage requested in the proposal was 500GB.

It turns out the dataset we process requires  over 1.6+TB. There is a shortage about 1.2TB. Could you please let me know if we can ask for some extra supplemental space, and what is  the process of requesting such space? We use Comet to process data and thus the storage needs to be accessible from Comet.

The project name is: Fast Neural Ranking for Top K Document Search | TG-IRI190005.

Thanks!
