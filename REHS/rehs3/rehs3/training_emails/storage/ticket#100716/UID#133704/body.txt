Hi, I am trying to run a software in my folder at "/home/alexys/public/Software/S4build_Jessica20151028", but it says permission denied. I ran the same software from my colleague's folder before, at "/home/jrylan/public/build/S4", and it was fine. I thought the default permission of a folder is anyone can read and execute? I have not changed any permissions of my folders. Thanks!
