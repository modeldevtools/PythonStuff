I've been running a code that gives me this error: 
QXcbConnection: Could not connect to display
/var/spool/slurmd/job13861304/slurm_script: line 8: 10254 Aborted                 python stellar_kinematics_cut.py

I'm unsure how to proceed. When I run the same python code ('stellar_kinematics_cut.py') from the command line, I get a slightly different error: 
OSError: [Errno 12] Cannot allocate memory

I originally thought this meant I really needed to be running the code through a shell, but now I'm unsure.

Thanks.
