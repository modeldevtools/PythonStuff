Hello,
It turns out that all new files on comet I create in home folder as well as in some folders where I run jobs have wrong group name, leading to jobs running out of disk space due to group storage restriction for that allocation.
The correct group number is ucd147, but the new files are assigned to usc108. See below:

 ls -lad /oasis/projects/nsf/ucd147/vorobyov/projects/herg/herg_dof_pulling/herg_o2_dof0/namd_us01/27/1.txt
-rw-r--r-- 1 vorobyov usc108 0 May 11 18:09 /oasis/projects/nsf/ucd147/vorobyov/projects/herg/herg_dof_pulling/herg_o2_dof0/namd_us01/27/1.txt

[vorobyov@comet-ln2 ~]$ ls -lad /home/vorobyov/1.txt 
-rw-r--r-- 1 vorobyov usc108 0 May 11 17:47 /home/vorobyov/1.txt

Could you please fix that?

Thanks a lot,
Igor.
