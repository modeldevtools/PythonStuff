Hi,

I am trying to run some small simulation on comet. But while I am trying to
copy some of my files in
/oasis/projects/nsf/ucr117/azahin/1-1/1MoSe-NbS/16.16.1/scf/band it is
showing me the "Disk quota exceeded" . I have deleted several of my
files/folders from comet which should create enough space for my current
simulation or at least to me copy my file in a new folder.

Comet ID : azahin

Please let me know if you need further information to solve this problem.

Thanks you
Adiba Zahin
