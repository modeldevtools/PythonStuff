Dear Amdin,

When I try to stripe a file among 96 OSTs on Lustre 
cp: writing `roads_32mb_c96/roads': No space left on device

I am copying a 24 GB file here:
/oasis/scratch/comet/spuri2/temp_project


There seems to be free space left here:
[spuri2@comet-ln2 temp_project]$ df -H .
Filesystem            Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on
192.168.0.6@tcp:192.168.8.6@tcp:/wombat
                      2.9P  2.6P  319T  89% /oasis/scratch/comet

Thanks and Regards,
Satish Puri
