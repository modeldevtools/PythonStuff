Hi there,

We am working on our project "Simulating the WFIRST Galaxy Redshift Survey | TG-AST180059". I was wondering that if this directory is the correct path to work and save data for this project:

/oasis/projects/nsf/cit176

We saved some data here, but my account summary doesn't present any information about it. So could you please correct me I was wrong?

Best,
Zhongxu
