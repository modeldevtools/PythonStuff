Dear person in charge,
I have been running my code on comet for about a month now and it worked fine. I had to transfer from SuperMIC that I could (unfortunately) not use anymore. Yesterday I tried to rerun older large calculations that I ran on SuperMIC in the past, however on comet it failed. Note that other smaller calculations work fine on comet. Now I remember I  already saw that a long time ago on comet and it is most likely the reason I had switched to SuperMIC. I do believe this could be a RAM issue as it fails when one array is allocated with a large number of elements (if I reduce the number of elements it works). On the other hand, I did not expect SuperMIC to absolutely outclass comet in terms of memory management so I am a bit surprise. Especially the memory is not that large in principle I believe. The error message is:

/var/spool/slurmd/job22017166/slurm_script: line 14: 26328 Segmentation fault  

Do you have any idea what it could be? I have changed -mcmodel from medium to large but it also failed. Now I am trying to get one of these large-memory nodes in the hope it will work but in principle I do not believe this calculation is that demanding in terms of memory, especially since it works fine on regular nodes on SuperMIC. Any help or advise would be appreciated.

My account is ndouguet and the runs that fail is in /home/douguet/NeonElena..the code is in SourceCodes/H-42-INUSE-v2-NEON where you can also see the Makefile I used to compile the code.

Thank you very much and best regards
Nicolas Douguet
