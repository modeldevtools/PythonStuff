Hello,

Our group received an email a while back that showed that we have not used
any of our storage on the Data Oasis for our project (MCB180042). However,
we have been storing the majority of our data at the following location:

/oasis/projects/nsf/csd579/$USER/

I was wondering how we should be accessing the Data Oasis in order to take
advantage of our 1000.0 GB allocation.

Thanks,
