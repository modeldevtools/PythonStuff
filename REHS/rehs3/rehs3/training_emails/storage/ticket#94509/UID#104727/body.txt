Hi,

I had a question about permissions on the server. I recently lost
permission to the comet server where I had my read data stored. I was
trying to install a Makefile from LTR harvester which installs
suffixerator, a pre-ltrharvester requirement. I still have access to that
and it's under the NSF/projects/ directory.  I was wondering if there was
any way to restore permissions for the /scratch/comet directory to access
my directory with the read data and/or have permissions to install the
Makefile on my directory under NSF/Projects?
p.s. the version of ltr-harvester I installed is version 1.5.9 and I tried
installing a different version of the program to see if it caused it.

Best wishes,

Joan Sandoval
