Hello,

I have been having trouble with getting my Gaussian jobs to run. 
My out file is giving me an error message of:
Out-of-memory error in routine Optmz1 (IEnd=    3612232688 MxCore=      33554432)
Use %mem=3445MW to provide the minimum amount of memory required to complete this step.

The first time we attempted to run this file, we specified 16GB of memory and 24 processors in the script file along with 1 node and 24 tasks per node in the run file. 
We received the error message above and the job died in 16 min.
This past time, we removed the memory and processor specifications from the script file and kept the run file as is. 
The same error message was in the out file and the job died in 41 sec. 

I have attached the script and run files along with the output files.

Thank you
