Hello,

Could you please assist with the following?

My most recent Gaussian simulations require computation time beyond 48 hours limit, but as for now the simulations terminate after 48 hours.

Would that be possible to push that time limit higher so the simulations can terminate properly?
Here are also the memory and processors allocations I use: Mem=80GB nprocshared=24.

Best,
Shimon
