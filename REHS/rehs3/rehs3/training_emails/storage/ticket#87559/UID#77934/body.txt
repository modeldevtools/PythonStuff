Hi,
I tried the gpu version of the executable and following is my job path.
/oasis/projects/nsf/nji105/kghatak/NEB

The problem is that the job is shown as running but output files such as
OUTCAR and others are not getting generated. Can you please check my
submission file (neb.sb) and let me know whether it is okay or not!

Thanks for your time.
