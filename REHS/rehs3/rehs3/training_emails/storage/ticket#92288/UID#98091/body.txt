Hi,

I am having a problem with storage. I am using
/oasis/projects/nsf/fiu106/narayan1
It looks like I ran out of my allowed space there. This is
surprising since I have not used anywhere close to what I have been allocated. Am I using the incorrect location for my storage?
Please help.

Thanks,
Rajamani.
