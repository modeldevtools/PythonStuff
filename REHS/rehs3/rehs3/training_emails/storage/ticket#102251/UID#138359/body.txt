I get a refused connection when I run the quota command on comet

"quota: error while getting quota from 132.249.108.47:/nsg for bsavoie (id 521023): Connection refused
quota: error while getting quota from ps-080.sdsc.edu:/ps-data/cosmic2/ for bsavoie (id 521023): Connection refused
quota: error while getting quota from 132.249.108.63:/ngbt for bsavoie (id 521023): Connection refused" 

based on du -h -a, my scratch usage is close to ~10Tb, so I'm guessing that this is the limit. I would like to request an additional 5 Tb of scratch space for the calculations I'm running. These will be transferred to local resources after the jobs complete. Do I need to do this through a supplement request? or can this be done at the system administrator level?

Thanks for your help,
Brett
