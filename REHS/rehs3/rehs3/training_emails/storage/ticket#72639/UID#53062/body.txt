Hi,

I would like to check to see how of the storage space in my scratch drive has been used up.  I am unsure how to do this... I tried "quota" as suggested on one xsede webpage but ended up with the following error:

quota: error while getting quota from ps-073.sdsc.edu:/ps-data/janssen3/ for jdoyle (id 516856): Connection refused
quota: error while getting quota from ps-077.sdsc.edu:/ps-data/gleesonlab for jdoyle (id 516856): Connection refused
quota: error while getting quota from ps-009.sdsc.edu:/ps-data/ngbt/ for jdoyle (id 516856): Connection refused
quota: error while getting quota from ps-036.sdsc.edu:/ps-data/gleesonlab for jdoyle (id 516856): Connection refused

Can you advise?

Best wishes,

J. Doyle
