When I run 'quota' I get errors:
[ellen@comet-ln2 source_data]$ quota
quota: error while getting quota from ps-073.sdsc.edu:/ps-data/janssen3/ for ellen (id 512267): Connection refused
quota: error while getting quota from ps-009.sdsc.edu:/ps-data/ngbt/ for ellen (id 512267): Connection refused
quota: error while getting quota from ps-038.sdsc.edu:/ps-data/nsg/ for ellen (id 512267): Connection refused

I am trying to use scp to move files from my own machine to comet, and I am getting 'Disk quota exceeded' messages. I am unclear if this is on a per-user basis, or per-project, or ?

I do think it's possible that I might be at or over quota.  But I'm not sure how I can tell if I have the space I need.

Because the work I need to do this week is pretty important, I have spent ~3 hours trying to delete things. Because I have many 100,000's or millions of small files, normal commands are painfully slow, or fail altogether because 'rm' has a file size limit. I try to use rsync -a --delete empty_dir/ my_dir but I am not sure if that always properly executes without using sbatch. Similarly I sometimes use perl -e 'for(<*>){((stat)[9]<(unlink))}' & but that doesn't recurse through directories. But it's frustrating because I can't see if I'm even making any progress towards clearing quota space.

Please let me know 
-how I can check my quota
-any commands better suited towards deleting large amounts of small files
-how often the quota is updated so I will know when  I can start working again.

Thanks,
-Jef
