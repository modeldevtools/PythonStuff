I am currently running a test job with a shared node with a single CPU. Unfortunately, I seem to be running out of space and getting this Python error:

IOError: [Errno 28] No space left on device

As far as I am aware, I am not utilizing an abnormal amount of disk space (~20 GB), so I am not sure why my job keeps failing due to this. Is there any way to specify the amount of space to allocate for a job with my slurm script? Many thanks for your assistance.
