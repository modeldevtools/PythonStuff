Good evening, I would like to report a problem when attempting to write on /oasis/scratch/comet.
My job crashes with the following error message:

error while writing variable:  ocean_time
in input file:  /oasis/scratch/comet/pstlaure/temp_project/out_ecb/run079/ocean_his_0007.nc
REASON: No space left on device

Is it possible that /oasis/scratch/comet is out of free space?

Thank you for your help, I appreciate it.
Pierre
