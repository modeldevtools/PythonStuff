Dear Sir/Madam,

My terminal screen is lagging for around 5 minutes. I have reported this issue previously. It was temporarily fixed. My working directory is 

/oasis/projects/nsf/rut129/akash12/

I am unable to modify and work on my files. The same issue is faced on a file exchange protocol platform.

Please advice me on what to do.

Thanks
Akash
