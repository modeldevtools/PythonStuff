Hi xsede,

I recently obtained a trial account through xsede with access to Comet/Data
Oasis. I am trying to transfer files into my project folder
(/oasis/projects/nsf/sds154/inaughto/) but receive the error message
"Storage Quota Exceeded". I do not have any files in my folder currently. I
am using Globus online to do the transfers.

Any advice here? From my understanding, I have 500 GB of storage..

Thanks much!
Ida
