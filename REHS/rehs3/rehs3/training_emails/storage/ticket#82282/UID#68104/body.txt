Hello helpers,

The job id 13769495, running Gaussian 09:  ES64L-G09RevD.01 program has crashed with a message:

galloc:  could not allocate memory.

I was wondering if this is a one-time event or a systemic problem with the jobs of this kind. If latter is the case would it be possible to resubmit the job with different execution parameters - more space allocation  - and have it completed.  This is the type of calculation  I will have to repeat many times and is essential for the project I am working on now.  Thank you very much.

Cheers,  Peter Ilich
