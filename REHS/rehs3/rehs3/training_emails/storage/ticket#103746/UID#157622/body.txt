Dear all, 
I am contacting you because I would like to ask you for help. I need to run GPAW calculations that require large memory RAM resources. Currently, I am using the compute partition and this is the message I get:
"slurmstepd: Exceeded step memory limit at some point"
I would like to ask you for help and guidance to prepare the run files for this GPAW calculations that allow me to use more than 128 GB/node of  memory. 
This is the path of my calculations:

I will very much appreciate your help. I look forward to hearing from you. 

Best regards,

Rosalba
