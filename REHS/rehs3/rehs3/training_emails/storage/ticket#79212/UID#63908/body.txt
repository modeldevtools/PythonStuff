Dear XSEDE Help,

I just finished running a job on COMET and I am trying to move the data
output to storage on:

  /oasis/projects/nsf/hvd134/rnarayan

However, it turns out that the default amount of space, namely 500GB, is
not enough. Is it possible to increase the allotted storage space? Right
now the data are located in

  /oasis/scratch/comet/rnarayan/temp_project/

but I don't want to keep the data there long-term since it will clog up the
work space unnecessarily.

The particular job I am trying to save requires about 1TB to store all the
generated data output.

I will probably run a couple of more jobs, and each will require about the
same amount of space. An allotment of 3TB, or better yet 5TB, would be very
helpful

Hope you can help. Thank you,

Ramesh Narayan
