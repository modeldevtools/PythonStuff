Hello,

I am trying to download a database files for some calculations. They are about 300 gb in total. I got an out of "gzip: uniref90.fasta: No space left on device" error even though I am using my lustre scratch space. Is there a quota for the lustre scratch? Is there a way to request it to be increased?

Thanks,
Shyam
