Hello,

We have run out of storage on our allocation between the emelstad/ and kmneal/ folders at /oasis/projects/nsf/cla182/ on Comet. I believe we are being capped at 500GB, however, while our allocation says it allows for 1000GB. Further, when I look at my Oasis allocation on my XSEDE portal it shows that we are using 0 of 1000GB. Are we putting our files in the wrong place to apply them to this 1000GB allocation?

Thanks very much!
Evan
