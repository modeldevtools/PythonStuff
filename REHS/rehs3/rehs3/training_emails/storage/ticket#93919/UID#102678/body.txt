Attn: Marty Kandes


SLURM job 18814076 failed with the error "memory not mapped" while running a function in my R code. The log file is in /home/llhenn/Copula/OrdDat/OrdDat_clcc/OrdDat_clcc_settings_group3_fail2Aug18.Rout.


I restarted the job with saved random number generator seed. It ran to completion without error.


It looks like this is one of the random hiccups of MPI that you have spoken of in the past. But I will wait to move forward with this job until I hear back from you.


Thanks,

Lisa
