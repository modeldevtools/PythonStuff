I am  trying to run a quite large job at Comet, it is using DFTB+ that was compiled at Comet by the help of  Martin Kandes of Xsede help. This is  about electron transport through a DNA, attached by thiol to the gold electrodes. I am getting message of Insufficient Memory after some run. The output data.dat is at /home/pkrstic/transport/dftbplus/_install/rundna.
The batch file is rrr.slurm, the input files are dftb_in.hsd and geometry is in in3.gen. 
I tried with partition=large-shared, with 500Gb at 1 node, I am getting similar message as the latest run at 20 nodes, at compute partition, with mem=100Gb.  
I need your help and some good advice. 
Thank you.
