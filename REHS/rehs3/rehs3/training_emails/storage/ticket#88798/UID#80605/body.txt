Hi,

would you please let me know how much space left in my home directory and would you please enlarge the space? I need to save large data files in my recent calculations.

Also, all my files and folds in the directory displayed in black. How can I make them display with different color? For instance, files in black, and fold in blue.

Many thanks,

Tao
