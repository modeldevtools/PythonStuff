Hi, a fellow Xsede user and collaborator and I would like to share data but globus tells me that I can't share my temp_project directory because "The administrator of this endpoint has disabled creation of shared endpoints on the selected path.. He is copied here and is Xsede user joel11; I am skimble5. Can you allow us to share our temp_project directories?


Thanks,

Steve
