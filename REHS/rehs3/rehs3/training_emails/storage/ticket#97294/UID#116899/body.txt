Dear Comet admins,

We have cleared off most of the files that were stored on the comet oasis to conform to our current quota of Â½ TByte.
At your advice we applied for and were granted an allocation on Wrangler long-term storage which is a better match for the data we had on your facility.
Thank you very much for accommodating us.

Best - Don
