I am running jobs that output into /oasis/scratch/comet/user, but have recently had problems due to no remaining storage space (the errors come from the program I'm running, not xsede). I can't find anywhere how much space I have available in scratch, only in my home directory. 

Can you direct me to this information please? 

Also, are there any addition large storage areas that I could use?

Thanks for your help,

Rachel
