Hello,

Since yesterday whenever I try to edit and save a file on

/oasis/scratch/comet/evitral/temp_project/dct1024/

the process just hangs indefinitely. I tried checking my quota, but it
doesn't seem to be the issue.

This problem doesn't show up on /oasis/projects/nsf/umn120/evitral/ neither
on my home directory.

Could you help me verifying this issue?

My ID name is *evitral* and I'm currently associated to the project *umn120*
.

Thank you,
Eduardo
