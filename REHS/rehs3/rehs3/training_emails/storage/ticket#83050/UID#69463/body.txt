Hi Mahidhar,

I submitted a job last Friday in Abaqus.  It existed with an error saying, "No Disk space available'.I had cleaned my directory before submitting my analysis. The incomplete result file was 1.1 GB. Please find the attached image with the error message. There are no error messages in .sta and .msg file. It is mentioned only in .out file.  

Thanks,
Mithila
