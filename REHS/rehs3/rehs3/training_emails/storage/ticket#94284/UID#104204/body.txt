PI Name: Donald Krieger
         PI Email: dnk9@pitt.edu
         Panel Type: Scientific
         Request Number: IBN130001
         Request Title: VERY HIGH RESOLUTION FUNCTIONAL BRAIN MAPPING
         Resources Requested: SDSC Dell Cluster with Intel Haswell Processors (Comet): 500,000.0 SUs
SDSC Medium-term disk storage (Data Oasis): 12,000.0 GB
         User Comments: I am seeing a disk quota overrun when I attempt to write to my oasis space.
Xdusage shows 4 TB allocated and 4 TB available.
The XSEDE portal shows my allocation to be 8 TBytes.
In any case, I havenâ€™t found a way to get the system to tell me how much I am actually using.

In order to deal with the immediate problem, I am requesting this advance on my allocation renewal.
I also have opened a ticket with the XSEDE desk about this so I can better manage this space.

Thanks - Don
Best Regards, XSEDE Allocations
