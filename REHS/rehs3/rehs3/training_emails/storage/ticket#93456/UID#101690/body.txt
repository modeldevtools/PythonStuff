Hello,

I have a couple of questions about issues I'm currently encountering in
Comet (username=mnagarka).

I keep encountering an error message of "disk quota exceeded." I've
recently gotten this when trying to tunnel an ipython notebook (>jupyter
notebook --no-browser --port=8890) and while trying to install qiime2 (it
outputs this after it says "solving environment..."). I am not sure if this
means I have too many files stored within my account (and I can't seem to
figure out how much storage I am using - I'm sure it's a simple command but
I'm not finding it on the user guide?) or whether I'm not requesting enough
computing power (1 node + 24 processors is what I've requested using srun).

Thanks for your help,

Maitreyi
