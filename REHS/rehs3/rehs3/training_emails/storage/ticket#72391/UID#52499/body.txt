Hi

when I login I see the following quotas:

Your current filesystem usages and quotas are:

   /home             0% used (48.0 KB of 20.0 GB)  
   /local-scratch    0% used (0.0 B of 2.0 TB)  

NOTE: The /local-scratch filesystem automatically deletes files older than
      60 days.


How can I access the stash filesystem on OSG as mentioned in this page: https://support.opensciencegrid.org/support/solutions/articles/12000006512-guidelines-for-data-managment-in-osg-storage-and-transfer
