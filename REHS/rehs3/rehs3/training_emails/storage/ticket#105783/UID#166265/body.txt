Hi,



I am running a Spark job on the Comet cluster. I am experimenting with various input sizes but for a particular file size I am getting a Java out of heap space error. I would like to know the memory utilization for that job so that I can use that information to make changes to my code. The SLURM JOB ID is 22099056. This job is currently running right now and I shall be really glad if you could help me with this.



With Regards,

Ram
