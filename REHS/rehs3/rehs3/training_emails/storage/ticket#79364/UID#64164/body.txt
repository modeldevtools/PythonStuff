Hello,

I'm trying to benchmark Gromacs on the P100 gpus, I have trouble running a large system, which crashes because of insufficient memory. I was able to successfully run the same script on a much smaller test system.
I am quite sure that for the large system, on other HPSC platforms I've never needed more than 2G per mpi rank, which makes me think I'm not properly requesting resources in my script. Do you have sample scripts for running gromacs on Comet with a system size of ~3M atoms? 

The script I'm trying to run is in (output files and logs also in same directory):
/oasis/scratch/comet/avaiana/temp_project/nodes_1-mpi_4-omp_07/jobscript.sh

Any help would be appreciated!

Cheers,
Andrea
