Hi,

My project (CTS180004) will be expired on 3/31/2019. I know that we cannot
charge compute time after the expiration date or the allocation is 100%
used. But I am wondering if I can access and download my data in my home
directory and in the direction of /oasis/scratch/comet/ after the
expiration date? Will you remove all my data after 3/31/2019? Thanks.

Geng
