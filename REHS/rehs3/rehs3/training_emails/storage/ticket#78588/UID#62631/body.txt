Hi,

We recently completed our Comet runs and have a fair amount of processed
data we would like to make available to the academic community by Globus.
Would it be possible to store a few hundred Gb on XSEDE resources and make
an anonymous Globus point for this data so people can access it (read only)?

Thank-you. We are exploring all options and are open to suggestions.

Regards,
Brendan
