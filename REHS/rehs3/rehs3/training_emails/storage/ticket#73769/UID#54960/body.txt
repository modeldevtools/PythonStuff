I'm trying to run a job but keep getting an error that says "slurmstepd: Exceeded step memory limit at some point.", and the job then fails. I'm running on 48 cores and tried using 72, but the problem persists.

I'm having trouble figuring out what might be causing the error. Some of my cases worked, while others didn't, so I'm not sure what I'm doing wrong. The path to one of my problem cases is located at: /oasis/scratch/comet/arygg/temp_project/dogs/lab. Thanks for your time!
