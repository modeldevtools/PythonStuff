Hello,

It looks like our XSEDE Research application was approved (TG-BIO170092). We have been able to use account csd568.

However on my portal I see we should have 1500 GB of space available, but we are now close to 500GB and I am already seeing disk quota exceeded errors.

How can I verify that we have 1500GB, and also is this the path we should be using? 

/oasis/projects/nsf/csd568/

Also does the quota apply to the whole directory or are individual users given quotas?

Best,
~Melissa
