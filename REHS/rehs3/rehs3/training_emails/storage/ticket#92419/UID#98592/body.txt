Hi, 

I am trying to use the xsede servers for running code on large datasets. I found out yesterday that my processes are getting killed because of memory issue and that I cannot write more to the disk. 

Presently, I have been using ~100GB of space but the new project I am working on requires around ~500 GB of space. I am therefore wondering, what are my options given my disk space requirement.

Thanks and regards,
Suhansanu.
