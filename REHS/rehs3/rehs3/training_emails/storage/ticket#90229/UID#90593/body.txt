We need to transfer a lot of data to the Sequence Read Archive.  They recommend Aspera or FTP.  Ftp sounds like a bad idea since we will be uploading ~100 ~16GB files in addition to some smaller exome and transcriptome data.  Is Aspera an option on Xsede or are there other ways that we should consider?
