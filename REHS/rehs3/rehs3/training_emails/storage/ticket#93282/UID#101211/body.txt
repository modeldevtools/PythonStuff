How do i know how large the storage space i can use?

when i login i got only information like this:
[2] Filesystems:

     (a) Lustre scratch filesystem : /oasis/scratch/comet/$USER/temp_project
         (Preferred: Scalable large block I/O)

     (b) Compute/GPU node local SSD storage: /scratch/$USER/$SLURM_JOBID
         (Meta-data intensive jobs, high IOPs)

     (c) Lustre projects filesystem: /oasis/projects/nsf
     
     (d) /home/$USER : Only for source files, libraries, binaries.
         *Do not* use for I/O intensive jobs.
