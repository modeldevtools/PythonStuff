Hi,

I have been trying to optimize my batch jobs and wanted to access the SSD storage allocated when the job has been submitted. I have a few questions I wanted to clarify before coding using this as a batch job mode. I have attached my script for reference as well.

1) When is the SSD storage accessible ? Once the job has been submitted to queue or once a compute node has been allocated. As such, if it is accessible once the compute node has been allocated, is the script within the sbatch run after allocation ? (I know it stands to reason it does but just want to clarify)

2) I have been trying to access the SSD storage from the terminal once the job has been submitted but unable to do so. Does that mean that the SSD is only accessible from within the sbatch script ? I have been using /scratch/$USER/$SLURM_JOBID to access. (in terminal and in script)

3) I ran a test case, files attached, and the case started running but the case started churning out output files in the oasis scratch. Which means I failed with my attempt to copy stuff to SSD and running the case there. Can you let me know from my script where I went wrong?

I shall be very thankful to you for your help

Regards,
Haris
