Hi there, 

I got two questions related to storage in Comet:
(1) What's the maximal memory space available for storage for a single person (project)?

(2) The end date of the current project is 2018-5-21. Therefore I need to remove all the data stored in comet before that date, otherwise, the data will be wiped out, right?
