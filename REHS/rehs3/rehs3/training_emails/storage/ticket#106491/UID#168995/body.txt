Hi,

I am running on LOCAL SCRATCH but I am wondering that I got the below error for one part of my job and it caused my job to get stuck, could you please let me know why I am facing this error?

srun: error: Unable to create job step: Memory required by task is not available

For your information, the job directory is /oasis/scratch/comet/mzare/temp_project/00-Pt/02-MEAN_FIELD_LJ_Pt-COH/01-FEP/test/DlpolyJdir/job-1

Thanks,
Mehdi
