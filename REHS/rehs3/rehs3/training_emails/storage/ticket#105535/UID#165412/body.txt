I received an email asking me to clean out my data in
/oasis/scratch/comet/heinema
I do not have a current XSEDE project - mine expired quite some time ago.
I assumed that the data was just purged since my understanding was that it
was only kept for 3 months after the end of the project.  Would you still
like me to clean out those files even though I do not have a current
award?  (I would be happy to do so if you like).

Sorry for any inconvenience
Matt
