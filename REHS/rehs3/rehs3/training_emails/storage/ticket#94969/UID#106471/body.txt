Is there any way my student (iescoba7) can access a model I already compiled on the cluster? 

It is located at /home/slope188/ParF

I thought that in adding here to this allocation I could also see her folders and assist with runs, but I do not see her on the list of users in the ~/home directory. 

Can someone please assist?
