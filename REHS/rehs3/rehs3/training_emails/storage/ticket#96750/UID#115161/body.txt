Hi,

I am looking for a way to search how much storage space our current allocation has left in the Oasis scratch system. I don't think we were told how much storage would be allotted to us for this allocation, and we recently uploaded some large files onto /oasis/scratch/comet/. Would there be any kind of error displayed to us if we attempt to write files into Oasis that would cause us to go over the storage limit? Thank you very much. 

Best,
Wei
