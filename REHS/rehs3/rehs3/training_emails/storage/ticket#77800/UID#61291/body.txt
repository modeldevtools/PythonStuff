I have been trying to access the comet scratch for about an hour on globus and keep getting directory timed out. This is not the first time this is happening. You guyd really need to figure out a better way of data transfer. What is the point of having a cluster to run large data sets if we cant transfer the data sets and work on them. PLEASE FIND A BETTER SOLUTION TO DATA TRANSFER OR CORRECT THE EXISTING ONE.
