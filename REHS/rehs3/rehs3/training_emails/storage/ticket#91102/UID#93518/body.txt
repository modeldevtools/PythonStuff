Hi,


I had questions on SU charging and the start up allocations:

1. For the start up allocation if we get allocated its mentioned that it could be unto 2,500 GPU hours ? How many SU's equivalent would these hours be?


2. I am trying to obtain a benchmarking for my simulations on the trial account that we have. As far as i checked the documentation, is this the right charging equation for both shared and non shared GPU queue ? also the wall clock time is in minutes right ??

Can you please let me know about these.


Thank you!!

Regards,
