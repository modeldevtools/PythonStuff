When attempting to copy files over from the scratch directory to the work directory, I get the error "Disk quota exceeded." In the work directory of our project, we currently have only about 14 GB of data. The limit is supposed to be 500 GB, on Oasis. What I find strange is that, when I check our allocation usage of Oasis on the XSEDE web portal, it shows 0 GB. Could you please help us resolve this issue?

Our project number is: riu124
Our allocation id is: TG-MCB180031
