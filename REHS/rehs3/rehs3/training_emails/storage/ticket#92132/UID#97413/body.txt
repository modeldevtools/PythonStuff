Hi,

I was looking through the user guide of comet and it said that comet has a parallel lustre filesystem. Is this basically where I can store files for my project, i.e. my user name is cwp710 so would I be able to store files in 

/oasis/scratch/comet/cwp710/temp_project

If so, what is the storage limit?

Thank you for your help,
Cheol Woo Park
