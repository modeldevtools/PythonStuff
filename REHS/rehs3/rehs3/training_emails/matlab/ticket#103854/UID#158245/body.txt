Hi,

I wish to Run Matlab via comet, but it seems that I am not in the Matlab group. I got following messages:

[anakim29@comet-14-01 ~]$ groups anakim29 matlab-users
anakim29 : crl120
groups: matlab-users: No such user

——————————————————————————————

groups anakim29 matlab-users
anakim29 : crl120
groups: matlab-users: No such user


I would appreciate if you can add me to the Matlab group.


Thanks,
Sangwoo Kim
