Hi. I am trying to 1) run matlab interactively via ssh 2) submit matlab jobs; however, 
1) after I load matlab, I tried but cannot run my .m files;
2) I followed the basic MPI jobs scripts on the xsede websites to write a slurm script for the matlab jobs but it is not working. Could you please teach me how to run matlab interactively on ssh and how to submit a matlab job? Thank you.
