I am trying to save an image sequence with PNG using the Matlab saveas function and it works fine interactively when I set up an X-windows connection, but when I submit it as a job, or when I run it without X-windows, it hangs. I am working in the following directory which contains the batch file and Matlab script. I am only trying to save 3 images as an initial test. 

/oasis/projects/nsf/csd516/jsale/sleep_neuromag/subj4/step8/delta/batch/

I'm sure it's related to my ignorance about how opengl runs on Comet, so any help would be appreciated. We want to automate the generation of many images for animation sequences.
