Hi

My name is Kuan Zhou. I am a PhD student at UC Riverside, supervised by Prof. Roger Lake. My topic in research is Electronic and Magnetic Properties of 2D Materials. 

For one project of mine-Edge states of graphene nanoribbons, I am working on calculation of edge states using Matlab. And it is crucial for the project to enable fast and accurate calculation in Comet high performance computing cluster. 

Thus I would like to ask: could you help install Matlab 2017 in Comet cluster? 

My user name is: kzhou003. 

Thanks. 

Best, 
Kuan Zhou
