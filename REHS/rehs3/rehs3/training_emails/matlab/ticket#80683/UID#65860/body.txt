I would like computer time to examine the physics of indirect excitons. Specifically, transport of excitons in a split gate device. From the abstract of the paper, a split gate device is realized for indirect excitons. The split gate forms a narrow channel, a point contact, for excitonic current. The width of this channel is determined by the device geometry and applied voltage. Control of excitonic current through the split gate device by gate voltage and excitation power is demonstrated. These simulations will be included in this paper.
 
To run these simulations, I would like 48 computer cores for approximately 4-5 days with 8GB of ram per core, any MATLAB version newer than 2013.
Thank you.
