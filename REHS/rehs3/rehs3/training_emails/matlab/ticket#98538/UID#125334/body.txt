Hello,

I am trying to run matlab on the SDSC Comet cluster and on their webpage they say if I am not in the matlab-users group to email you to be added. I can load the matlab module but can not launch matlab as it appears to not be in my PATH. My XSEDE username is naughton. Can you please add me to the correct group or point out where I am going wrong in running matlab? Thanks!

Best,
Noel Naughton
