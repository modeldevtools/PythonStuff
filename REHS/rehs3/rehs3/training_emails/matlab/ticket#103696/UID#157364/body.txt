Hi,

I am working on an allocation in the Comet-GPU cluster, and I'm have some trouble running Matlab code. After transferring my necessary files to my account, I found the sample Matlab batch script, and at the bottom, I copied verbatim the lines of code from the sample to execute a Matlab file:

module load matlab

matlab -nodisplay -nosplash <

AllClass_ThreeChannelTif_SegNetImplementation_RandomGridSearch.m

However, when I ran this, the job gave me this output:
/var/spool/slurmd/job21390628/slurm_script: line 10: matlab: command not found

I am not sure where this error is arising from. For reference, I ran this job on the -gpu partition, this is job number 21390628. Where did I go wrong?

Thank you,

Alan Shenkerman
