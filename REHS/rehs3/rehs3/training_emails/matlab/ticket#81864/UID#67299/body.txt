Hello,

I am currently in the process of performing scaling studies on COMET and a few parts of my code require MATLAB to be used. However, I am unable to access MATLAB on COMET even though it shows that the MATLAB module is loaded.

I would really appreciate it if you could help me out with this.

Thanking you.

With best regards,
