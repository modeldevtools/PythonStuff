Greetings XSEDE support,
     We had some questions on data visualization on Comet, please see if you could answer.

Conventionally, we download the data and then Visualize it on a local workstation using Matlab scripts & Paraview.

*         Wondering how we can do this, via Comet without the need to download data.

*         Are there Matlab  and Paraview available on Comet or other XSEDE systems that could be used for the visualization tasks.

Thanks,
-Srujan
