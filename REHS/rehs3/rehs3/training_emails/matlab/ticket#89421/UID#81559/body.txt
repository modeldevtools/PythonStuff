Hello all:

Today I found a very strange problem I can not explain myself. When I only
apply one CPU in my batch script to run MATLAB just like this:

*matlab -nodisplay -r XXX > logfile &*

The job is cancelled as long as it runs. However, it could be properly
executed if I comment out the & sign.

Later, I wrote a script applying several CPUs within one node and assign
them to each MATLAB task submitted in the same way as above: *matlab
-nodisplay -r XXX > logfile & *, it could be successfully run on comet. As
a comparison, I am confused that why several tasks could be run at the
background while it fails in only one CPU? Could you please help me explain
that?

Thanks,
