Hi,
I am new to the comet; when I required two cores in one node in non-GUI interactive mode to run my matlab code from my home directory, everything goes smooth; however, when it encounters the final linear solver phase, "Killed" is prompted with no other information for debug. 

I tried it twice and both are killed at the same place (I am not very sure but since I have printed some information so it should be around the same place). It should be around a parfor(i, M=2) loop. This code used parfor a lot and this is not the first parfor it encounters. But this parfor will parallelly run a big function involving some large vector matrix multiplication (probably ~10 G for each core), so I wonder maybe this is the reason? Since there is no more information than a word "Killed", can you help me to figure out what can I do next?

Best
Runren
