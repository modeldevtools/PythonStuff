Hi,


My name is Ying Lin, a fourth year PhD student from Economics Department at Kansas State University.


I am writing to you to request to add me (ly281044@comet.sdsc.edu) to the Matlab groups on Comet.

My field of study is Industrial Organization. I am using Matlab for the econometric model estimation.

I am wondering if it would be possible that you could add me to the Matlab group?


Our local HPC representative provided me the access to Comet. I am also wondering how long it will take me to get into the system.


Thank you very much for your help!


Best,

Ying Lin
