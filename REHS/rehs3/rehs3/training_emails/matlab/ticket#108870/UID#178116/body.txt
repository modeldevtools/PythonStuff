Hi,

I was trying to run a small matlab script from the terminal window, without submitting a batch script., based on the guidelines here:
https://www.sdsc.edu/support/user_guides/tutorials/matlab.html

I checked that my allocation was on the matlab-users group and loaded the matlab module. 
I then went into compute mode with this command, as specified:
$ srun --partition=debug --pty --nodes=1 --ntasks-per-node=1 -t 00:30:00 --wait=0 --export=ALL /bin/bash

However, after loading the matlab module. when I attempt to run matlab, it gives the message saying "bash: matlab: command not found".

Could I please know how to remedy this? I wanted to debug my scripts first, before running larger jobs through actually submitting a script as a job file. 

Thanks and kind regards,
Partha
