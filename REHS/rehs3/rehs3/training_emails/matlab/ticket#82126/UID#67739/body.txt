Hello,

I need a faster way of running my matlab code. But, I'm wondering if my code would run faster on Comet compared to my personal computer because I am not using GPU optimization. 

Therefore, I have two questions:

1) Can I run matlab files on Comet?
2) Will my code run faster on Comet even though it does not use GPU optimization?

Thank you,
