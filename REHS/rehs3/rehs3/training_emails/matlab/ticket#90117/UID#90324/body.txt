I am interested in using Matlab for data reduction on comet.  I loaded the module, but it’s not obvious what to do after that.  I see that /opt/matlab/2016b/bin has been added to my path, but typing “matlab” does nothing.  I also gather that there are licensing issues.  For better or for worse, I have an individual license and I hope that there is a way that I can use this on comet.

Thanks,

Scott Springer
