Hello,

I have been trying, unsuccessfully, to use MATLAB's parallel computing toolbox through a sbatch script running on Comet. I cannot manage to connect to more than 12 workers, regardless of the number of nodes I am connected to.

I could only find information online about using MATLAB's parallel computing toolbox with the GUI https://www.sdsc.edu/support/user_guides/tutorials/matlab.html. Would you be able to point me towards some resources for doing this within a script run directly on Comet?

Thanks,
Eli Weissler
