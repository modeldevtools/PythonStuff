Dear Sir/Madam,

I am a PHD student at Duke and my Id in XSEDE is "reza1789". I want to use matlab software through the comet supercomputer. I have tried to the follow the instructions but I was unable to get access to matlab.
I would appreciate if you could help me join matlab group (currently I am just a member of "dku124") and guide me how to run my mat files there.
Please let me know if you need more information.

Thank you for your time.

Best,
Reza
