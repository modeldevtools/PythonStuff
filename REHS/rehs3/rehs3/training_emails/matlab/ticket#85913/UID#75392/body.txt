Hi,

I was wondering if I can be added to the Matlab group. I need it for some
analysis that I am planning to do.

Also, from the examples that are available online or on the server it is
not clear to me how to run Matlab script on more than 1 processor/core. Do
I use the ibrun in the following way?

ibrun matlab -nodisplay -nosplash < Example.m

if I for example request 2 nodes and 24 tasks per node?

or it is not required and I say "matlab -nodisplay ...." directly?

Thanks,
