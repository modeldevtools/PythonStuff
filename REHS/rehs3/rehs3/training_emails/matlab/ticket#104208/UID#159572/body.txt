To those it may concern,
We are running Matlab programs in Comet for our research projects. 

1) One of our data is about 1-2GB. Our Matlab program needs to take inverse matrix in some steps. Our program was terminated with a warning of out of memory. 

2) For other dataset, we also received a warning as following: 
>> >> >> >> >> >> >> >> >> >> >> >> >> >> >> >> >> >> >> >> slurmstepd: Exceeded step memory limit at some point.

Any guidance will be highly appreciated! 

Best regards,
