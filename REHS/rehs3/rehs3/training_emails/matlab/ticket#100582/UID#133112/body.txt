Hello,

I am the new Campus Champion for Harvey Mudd College and I want to test using MATLAB simulations for a senior undergrad at HMC. Can you please add me to the MATLAB user group and also direct me to resources to help me understand how to use Comet for this purpose? 

Thank you so much.

Best,
Aashita
