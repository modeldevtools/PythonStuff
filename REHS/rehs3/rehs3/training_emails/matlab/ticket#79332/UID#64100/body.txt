Dear Sir or Madam,


my name is Christian Grimm and I want to use the matlab module on comet for my research simulation at University of Wisconsin at Milwaukee. So far, the module can't be loaded, which might be because I am not yet registered in the "Matlab group".


Would you be so nice and add me to that group so that I have the permission to use the matlab module in my research project?

My username is grimm4, and grimm4@uwm.edu is the email adress I used for registering on Xsede.


I will happily consider providing you more information if needed.


Have a great day,


Christian Grimm
