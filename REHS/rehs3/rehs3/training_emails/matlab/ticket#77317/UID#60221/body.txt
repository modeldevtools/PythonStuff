Dear Comet Staff,

I was trying to use matlab on Comet, but it always showed matlab command
not found even though I loaded matlab. And, it could not find matlab when I
tried "which matlab". Do you know what is going wrong? Thanks.

Here is the script:

module load matlab
matlab -nodisplay <individual.m>logmat

Thanks,
Tianli
