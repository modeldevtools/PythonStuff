Hello,


I am a PhD candidate in Prof. Shanhui Fan's group at Stanford University. We have an allocation in Comet. My username for Comet is buyukalp.


Can I use Matlab in Comet? This website tells me I needed to contact you to be added in the matlab group.

Also, do we need to pay for anything to use MATLAB in Comet?


Thank you,


Yasin
