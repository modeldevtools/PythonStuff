Hello,

I am user mmadany in group ddp140

I am requesting to be added to the Matlab UNIX Parallel Computing group on
Comet. This is different than being added to the base Matlab group, which I
am in already.

The documentation says this service is only offered to members of groups in
degree-granting institutions. I work in the Mark Ellisman lab at University
of California, San Diego.

Thanks in advance.

Best,
Matthew Madany
