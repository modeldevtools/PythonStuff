I am trying to run a Matlab script on Comet. I tried loading the module using module load matlab/2018a using script and then passing matlab command: matlab -r BayesOptim -nojvm -nodesktop -nodisplay -nosplash -sd "/oasis/scratch/comet/h7ris/temp_project/OptimizationAlgoTest/OptimizationCometTest/" -logfile Optimization.log

(all within a script)

It return the error matlab command not found. This from what I understand is the standard Linux syntax for running matlab (official documentation)

Other than this, exactly how do I call all the compute processors to run a single script. From what I understand, Matlab already does multiple threading as default or large calculation. Do I need to invoke mpirun or ibrun at any point ? Or should I just subit the job to say 5 nodes, and just just run the script with no mpirun 

Regards,
Haris
