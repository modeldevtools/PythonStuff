[Category: Allocations]
I get the following messages when I request a debug node on Comet with my TG-TRA170016 allocation. I was able to do this a couple of weeks ago before I went on vacation. FWIW, I am able to run Matlab jobs on Comet with a remote Windows client using the same allocation. 

[jsale@comet-ln2 MATLAB]$ srun --partition=debug --pty --nodes=1 --ntasks-per-node=1 -t 00:30:00 --wait=0 --export=ALL /bin/bash
srun: error: bank_limit plugin: not found user association jsale
srun: error: Unable to allocate resources: Invalid account or account/partition combination specified
