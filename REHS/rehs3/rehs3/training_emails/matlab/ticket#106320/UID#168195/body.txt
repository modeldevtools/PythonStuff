Dear Sir/Madam,

I would like to access matlab in comet for post processing some data. I'm not able to open matlab even after adding the matlab module. The documentation states that I should be added to Matlab user group. It would be very helpful if you can add my account to the matlab user group in comet. My SDSC user name "sukruths".

Thanks
Sukruth
