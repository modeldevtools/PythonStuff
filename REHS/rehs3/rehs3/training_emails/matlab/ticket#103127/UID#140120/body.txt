Hi there,

     I was wondering if I could be added to the matlab-user group on Comet?

I noticed in the online documentation for running matlab there, they use 
the example of starting an interactive job in the debug queue.  Is it 
also allowed to start a job on a single node of the 'shared' queue to 
have a longer period of time to work with?

Thank you,

Scott Durski
