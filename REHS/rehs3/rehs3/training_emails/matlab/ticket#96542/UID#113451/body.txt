Marty,

After a visit from one of the faculty in the Dept. of Astronomy at UW, some
difficulties understanding the nodelist command at the LLNL site, and
a clue that gnu is widely used, I decided to just copy the code
that you so generously sent.

Below [1], you can see that I am having a presumably small issue with
running your script that "sudo" wouldn't solve -- predictable, actually.

I will also write a johnny-version of your script to run some changa code
in parallel for tomorrow, hopefully.

Best,

johnny
