Hi,

I apologize for the inconvenience, but I have one more question about using Matlab on Comet-GPU. My code now runs great, but I would like to access the Matlab GUI, which it says is possible on the Comet Matlab tutorial here: https://www.sdsc.edu/support/user_guides/tutorials/matlab.html. However, when I connect to a GPU node, ssh -X to the node in a new terminal window, and type in the commands as listed in the tutorial, I just get command line Matlab, not the GUI. Could you help with this issue?

Thanks,

Alan Shenkerman
