My colleagues use Matlab on Comet.   But when I try it,  I got the following:
"
leexl@comet-ln3.sdsc.edu:~/.ssh$ module load matlab
leexl@comet-ln3.sdsc.edu:~/.ssh$ which matlab
alias matlab='matlab -nodisplay -nosplash '
leexl@comet-ln3.sdsc.edu:~/.ssh$ matlab
-bash: matlab: command not found
leexl@comet-ln3.sdsc.edu:~/.ssh$ 
"
Could you please help me to use Matlab on Comet?
