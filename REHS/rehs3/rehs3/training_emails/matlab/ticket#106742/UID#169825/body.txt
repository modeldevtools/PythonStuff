Hello Sir or Madam, 

I'm new to XSEDE. I have a problem when using Matlab. I logged in comet.sdsc.xsede.org, and module load matlab; I can see I did load successfully when typing module list, and it shows

[xiehu@comet-ln3 AT35]$ module list
Currently Loaded Modulefiles:
  1) intel/2013_sp1.2.144   3) gnutools/2.69
  2) mvapich2_ib/2.1        4) matlab/2018a

But when I typed Matlab it shows 
-bash: matlab: command not found

Kindly please let me know how to access matlab.

Cheers,
Xie
