Hello,

I would like to use matlab on Comet but cannot find the right command to use the software.

I tried to follow the example script "matlab.sb" in "/share/apps/examples/MATLAB" folder, but got the following error message

"/var/spool/slurmd/job23811418/slurm_script: line 14: matlab: command not found"

Could you please help me find the right command to run matlab?

Thanks.

Best,
Teng
