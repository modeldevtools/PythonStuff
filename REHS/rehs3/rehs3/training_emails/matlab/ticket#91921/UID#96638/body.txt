Hello,
I am Lei Zhang. My XSEDE ID is lzhang14.  I designed a Matlab script according to the link here. I submitted this job on /oasis/projects/nsf/ddp322/lzhang14/plot_matlab. However, I got an error report like this:
/var/spool/slurmd/job17920422/slurm_script: line 13: matlab: command not found

It is our first time to use Matlab on Comet. Could you please help us to fix this? Thank you in advance.


Best regards,


Lei
