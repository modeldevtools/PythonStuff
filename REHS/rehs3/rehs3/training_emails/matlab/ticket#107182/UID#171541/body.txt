Dear Sir/Madam, 

I hope all is well. I have been using SDSC resources via comet since September 2018 and through the December 2018/January 2019 period, I was able to easily transfer files from my computer to your endpoint (through GLOBUS) and with your help eventually run matlab through XSEDE. 

Over the past few days, I have since logged on and attempted to run Matlab files and the interface has changed and it does still contain the endpoint called "my computer" but the end point called "My computer at SDSU" is not working and when I tried opening this file transfer window to transfer files, the computer tells me: 

Globus Connect Personal Is Not Running
The Globus Connect server is not connected. Please check if the Globus Connect application is running and the computer is connected to the network.
The Globus Connect Personal endpoint 'd8a91f5d-f9bc-4de3-b0c0-092cb07f5f7e (812ca82e-63d2-11e9-bf44-0e4a062367b8)' is not currently connected to Globus

I dont remember this error before. More importantly, I cannot do anything to connect to this server and run Matlab files from your server. 

Am I doing something wrong? Thanks for your patience and for your help and I appreciate all your help and guidance in making sure that I can run those matlab-based algorithms. 

Thanks and I look forward to your response and appreciate a fast one. 

Best regards, 

Januj
