Hi I got an error when loading matlab:

[liuqian@comet-ln2 ~]$ srun --partition=shared --pty --nodes=1 --ntasks-per-node=16 -t 48:00:00 --wait=0 --export=ALL /bin/bash
srun: job 16762966 queued and waiting for resources
srun: job 16762966 has been allocated resources
[liuqian@comet-07-47 ~]$ module load matlab
[liuqian@comet-07-47 ~]$ matlab -nodisplay
bash: matlab: command not found

Thanks in advance for your help!

Regards,
Liuqian
