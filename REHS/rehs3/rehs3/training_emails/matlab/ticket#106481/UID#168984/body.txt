Hi,

I have an issue on submitting Matlab jobs. I am able to request an
interactive node and run matlab in the interactive node. However, when I
try to submit matlab jobs using SLURM, I was told: "the batch job
submission failed: job violates accounting/QOS policy". I think it might be
because I am not an active user in the matlab group. If that is the case,
could you please add me to that group? My username is <yanyuj>. Thank you
very much for your help.

Best,
Yujie
