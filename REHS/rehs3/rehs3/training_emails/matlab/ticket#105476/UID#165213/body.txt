Dear XSEDE,



Hope this finds you well. I am a postdoctoral fellow with Terrence Sejnowski at the Salk Institute (associated with UCSD). I have an allocation of 100,000 core-hours on Comet (user: lm2), and I’m wondering whether I could be added to the MATLAB users group.



I would like to run a quick parameter scan for a simulation with several hundred cores. For this, if there are any issues that might come up (licensing, etc.), please don’t hesitate to let me know.



Best wishes,



LM
