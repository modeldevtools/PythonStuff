[Category: Software]
Dear Help Desk team,

I would like to run some matlab job on comet, but it seems that I'm not in the matlab user group. My XSEDE account is "haunter" and my comet username is "zhwang".

I also don't have activated credentials for matlab on other supercomputing resources including supermic and bridges.

Is there a way to have my account certified for matlab?

Thank you!
Zhepei Wang
