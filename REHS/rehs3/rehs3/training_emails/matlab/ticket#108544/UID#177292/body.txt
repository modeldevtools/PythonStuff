HI,
I am having trouble setting up parallel computing with matlab when I want
to use more than 24 cores at once. This is based on the tutorial here:
https://www.sdsc.edu/support/user_guides/tutorials/matlab.html
1. I realized that using the sbatch matlab.sb script only utilizes 12
cores, even if I request 60 nodes =12*60 =720 cores. (script attached, the
matlab script that it runs has "parfor" loops which should ideally use all
available cores)
2. Using the local computer -> remote parallel job method on Matlab2018a
and running example job from the tutorial page:* run_testparfor1 * runs
into the following error:
Error using parallel.internal.customattr.CustomGetSet/set (line 43)
The property 'IndependentSubmitFcn' cannot be configured as it is no longer
supported.

Error in getCluster (line 7)

 set(cluster,'IndependentSubmitFcn',{@independentSubmitFcn,clusterHost,RemoteDataLocation,account,username,keyfile,time,queue});

The only way I have been able to use 60 cores is my using my local machine
on matlab 2016a and submitting jobs via it to the cluster. However, I would
really like to run my codes on matlab 2018a. Please help!

Saumya
