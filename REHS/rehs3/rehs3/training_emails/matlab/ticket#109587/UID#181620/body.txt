Hi,

I got a problem with running Matlab with GUI in Comet and hope you can help
me figure out what the problem is.

I am using a mac to access the Comet and have installed Xquartz to run the
GUI. I tested the Xquarts and found it works when I connect to a server
using SSH. I have also tested it using the login node in Comet. What I did
is 1) ssh the comet server; 2) load the Matlab module in the login node
directly; 3) call Matlab and the Xquartz runs the GUI. However, when I
request an interactive job in debug partition, the GUI does not pop up
while the Matlab is actually running as a nodisplay mode. Could you please
help me figure out what the problem is? Below is the command I use to
request the interactive job:

srun --partition=debug --pty --nodes=1 --ntasks-per-node=24 -t 02:00:00
--wait=0 --export=ALL /bin/bashsrun

Thanks,
Yujie
