I was trying to run a script in matlab on the command line on Comet and I keep getting and error that it does not see matlab anywhere. I tried going to the example matlab submission script and that does not work either. I tried 'module load matlab' but it still does not find matlab. It looks like matlab should be there from the documentation, but I cannot get it to run. Any advice is appreciated.
