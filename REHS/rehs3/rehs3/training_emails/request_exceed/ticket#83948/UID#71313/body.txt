Hi I'm testing the Comet trial allocation and I encounter the following error:
[dtorres@comet-ln2 6-2.txt]$ qsub script 
There was an error running the SLURM sbatch command.
The command was:
'/usr/bin/sbatch script  2>&1'
and the output was:
'sbatch: error: bank_limit plugin: The requested time can not exceed the available balance.
 Requested SUs: 13
 Allocation limit group SUs: 100000
 Allocation limit user SUs: 1000
 Allocation used group SUs: 82619
 Allocation used user SUs: 277
 Allocation available group SUs: 17381
 Allocation available user SUs: 723
 Allocation running/queued group SUs: 0
 Allocation running/queued user SUs: 0
 Allocation completed today group SUs: 722
 Allocation completed today user SUs: 716
 sbatch: error: Batch job submission failed: Requested time limit is invalid (missing or exceeds some limit)
Does this mean I already exhausted my allocation? Also at the https://portal.xsede.org when I log in I see
omet Rapid Access Project
Project PI:Tatineni, Mahidhar Charge #:TG-ASC150024
Am I using the right account and right allocation?
If i exhausted the allocation, there would be perhaps a way to extend a bit this allocation?
Thanks in advance and best regards
Daniel
