Hi,

I am trying to submit a job on COMET using GROMACS script:
#!/bin/bash
#SBATCH -p compute
#SBATCH -A "TG-MCB180043"
#SBATCH --nodes=3
#SBATCH --ntasks-per-node=24
#SBATCH -t 48:00:00
#SBATCH -o pure-popc-100-200ns.out
#SBATCH -e pure-popc-100-200ns.out
#SBATCH -J pure-popc-100-200ns
#SBATCH --export=ALL
module unload intel
module load gromacs
exe=`which gmx_mpi`
processors=$(( $SLURM_NNODES * $SLURM_NTASKS_PER_NODE ))
mpirun  -np $processors -genv I_MPI_FABRICS shm:ofa $exe mdrun -v -deffnm pure-popc-100-200ns

Under the following directory: /oasis/scratch/comet/malwaraw/temp_project/pure-popc-512/100-200ns

After using sbatch gromacs.cpu.sb, It gives me the following error:

sbatch: error: bank_limit plugin: Can't find teragrid association for TG-MCB180043
sbatch: error: Batch job submission failed: Invalid account or account/partition combination specified

When I remove #SBATCH -A "TG-MCB180043", It gives me the following error:

sbatch: error: bank_limit plugin: The requested time can not exceed the available balance.
Requested SUs: 3457
Allocation limit group SUs: 50000
Allocation limit user SUs: 50000
Allocation used group SUs: 47591
Allocation used user SUs: 5126
Allocation available group SUs: 2409
Allocation available user SUs: 44874
Allocation running/queued group SUs: 0
Allocation running/queued user SUs: 0
Allocation completed today group SUs: 0
Allocation completed today user SUs: 0
sbatch: error: Batch job submission failed: Requested time limit is invalid (missing or exceeds some limit)

Does it mean that I still did not get the allocation of June 15th? Under my account on Xsede it show that I have the allocation and its active. 

When I use:  show_accounts
It give the following:
ID name      project      used     available    used_by_proj
------------------------------------------------------------
malwaraw     iit105       5126     50000        47591

To charge your job to one of these projects replace  << project >>
with one from the list and put this Slurm directive in your job script:
#SBATCH -A << project >>

Which show that I do not have the TG-MCB180043 allocation. Am I right?

Thanks
Mohammad
