Dear Comet administrator,


I am a Comet user under Arieh Warshel's group. In the near future I will need to run some heavy jobs, which requires lots of space. The current storage limit under my account seems to be 100 G. I am not sure what's the total storage limit of our group but if you can increase my storage above 500 G it would be very helpful.


Best Regards,

Chen
