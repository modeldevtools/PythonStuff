Hi.

When I submitted a VASP job using qsub, I got the
following errors. My job script is attached.

=================
There was an error running the SLURM sbatch command.
The command was:
'/usr/bin/sbatch comet_pbs_job  2>&1'
and the output was:
'sbatch: error: bank_limit plugin: The requested time can not exceed the 
available balance.
  Requested SUs: 5761
