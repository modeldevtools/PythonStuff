Hi,

I was recently awarded an allocation on Comet (Charge # TG-CHE180076), however, I am also currently utilizing Prof. Dean Tantillo's allocation (Charge # TG-CHE050017N). I'd like to use the former instead, but they are both on Comet. How can I make sure I am only using the former allocation?

Best,
Croix
