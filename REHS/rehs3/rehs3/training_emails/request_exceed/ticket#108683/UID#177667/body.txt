Hi, 

I was wondering if there is a lag in updating the remaining SUs and burn rates associated with COMET GPUs?  



The ~18000 SUs that is left on my account seems to be the same since the past week although I am activating running calculations on the GPU nodes. 
If there is a delay in the updates on the website, is it possible to know my current SUs in some other way? 

Thanks for the help, 
Kartik
