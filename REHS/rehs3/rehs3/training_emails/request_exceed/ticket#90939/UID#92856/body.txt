Hi,

As of 27 June, my lab's unused allocation was 74407 SUs.  However, this morning, my students are getting the error message below when trying to submit jobs on Comet.  Is my allocation exhausted, or it is a matter of my lifting limits on SU use for specific users.

Thank you very much for your help!

sbatch: error: bank_limit plugin: The requested time can not exceed the available balance.
