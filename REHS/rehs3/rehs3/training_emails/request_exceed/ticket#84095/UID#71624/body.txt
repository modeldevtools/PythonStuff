I'm getting this error code when trying to run a batch script

sbatch: error: bank_limit plugin: The requested time can not exceed the available balance.
Requested SUs: 193
Allocation limit group SUs: 2500
Allocation limit user SUs: 2500
Allocation used group SUs: 1493
Allocation used user SUs: 1493
Allocation available group SUs: 1007
Allocation available user SUs: 1007
Allocation running/queued group SUs: 2699
Allocation running/queued user SUs: 2699
Allocation completed today group SUs: 0
Allocation completed today user SUs: 0
sbatch: error: Batch job submission failed: Requested time limit is invalid (missing or exceeds some limit)

I should have enough SUs left on my allocation to run this
