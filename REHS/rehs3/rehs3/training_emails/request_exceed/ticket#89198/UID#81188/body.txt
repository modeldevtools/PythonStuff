Hello Team, 

I am trying to execute a SPARK script on Comet from aroy18. The same script is being successfully executed by one of my fellow users from his account (jalsawwa). Below is the error I am getting. Is there any issue with resource allocation? 

18/05/29 10:20:48 WARN scheduler.TaskSchedulerImpl: Initial job has not accepted any resources; check your cluster UI to ensure that workers are registered and have sufficient resources

Thanks & Regards, 
Arighna Roy
