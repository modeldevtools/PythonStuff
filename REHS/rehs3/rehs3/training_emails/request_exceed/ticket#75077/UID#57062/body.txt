Hello,

My job needs 124G to run the program, and I request for 140G on the large-shared node. However, when I check the output, it returns the message as "

slurmstepd: Exceeded step memory limit at some point."  Does it mean that I need to request for more memory to run my job? Or is there any solution? My job id is 11115674.

Thanks,
Shengnan
