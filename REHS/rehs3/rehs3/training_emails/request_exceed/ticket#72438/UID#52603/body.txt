My allocation page tells me I've used 453 SUs (of 50k) but I keep getting this error message when I try to sbatch:

[skimble5@comet-ln2 all_samples_minus_related]$ sbatch submittercomet.sh
sbatch: error: bank_limit plugin: The requested time can not exceed the available balance.
Requested SUs: 481
Allocation limit group SUs: 50000
Allocation limit user SUs: 1000

Allocation available user SUs: 490
Allocation running/queued group SUs: 193
Allocation running/queued user SUs: 0
Allocation completed today group SUs: 160
Allocation completed today user SUs: 144
sbatch: error: Batch job submission failed: Requested time limit is invalid (missing or exceeds some limit)

Thanks,
