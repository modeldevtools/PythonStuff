Hello, today when I was attempting to start a new simulation the following message came up:

[jgravell@comet-ln2 DM_MO_150_E]$ qsub comet_lammps_single.txt
There was an error running the SLURM sbatch command.
The command was:
'/usr/bin/sbatch comet_lammps_single.txt  2>&1'
and the output was:
'sbatch: error: bank_limit plugin: The requested time can not exceed the available balance.
 Requested SUs: 577
 Allocation limit group SUs: 50000
 Allocation limit user SUs: 50000
 Allocation used group SUs: 40304
 Allocation used user SUs: 13579
 Allocation available group SUs: 9696
 Allocation available user SUs: 36421
 Allocation running/queued group SUs: 10377
 Allocation running/queued user SUs: 0
 Allocation completed today group SUs: 0
 Allocation completed today user SUs: 0
 sbatch: error: Batch job submission failed: Requested time limit is invalid (missing or exceeds some limit)

It seems that my requested SUs is well below the available group and user SUs available. Why is it not being accepted then? Thank you for your assistance.
