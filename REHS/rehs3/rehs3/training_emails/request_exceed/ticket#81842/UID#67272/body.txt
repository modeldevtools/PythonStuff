I tried submitting a job to the compute queue on Comet today, Sunday, 14 January. I believe I was denied because the product of (wall clock) x (cores requested) exceeded the number of service units I had left in my account. Even after I edited the batch file so that the product was less than my remaining balance, Comet would not authorize the job. It appears that it continues to have a hold on my account based on the requested SU's, despite those jobs being denied authorization. Please refer to the transcript at the end of this message. Note that I edited the wrong queuing file at first.


I would like to get my account cleared so that I can submit new jobs. I am attempting some last benchmarking runs prior to the deadline for research allocation requests tomorrow, Monday 15 January. To that end, I am also hoping to confirm with you that I have sufficient overhead in my account to ensure the jobs will be authorized to start.


I have 8 jobs planned for a total of 1248 SU's. I expect them to take between 0.25 and 4 hours. I would like to request more wall clock than that, though, in case I have underestimated the time required for the jobs. I would hate for them to time out because I was too penurious with the wall clock.


If I ask for 8 hours of wall clock for each job, that implies a hold of 9984 SU's on my account. As my balance currently is 12915, I believe those jobs should start, once my account is freed up. Do I understand correctly? If not, I would appreciate clarification so that I can adjust my jobs or ask for a supplement as needed.


Thank you for your assistance.


Sincerely,

Lisa Henn
