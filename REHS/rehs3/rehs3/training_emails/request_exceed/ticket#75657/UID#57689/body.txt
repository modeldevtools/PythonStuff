Dear Sir/Madam, 

I was trying to submit a job using sbatch on Comet. I get the following error, saying that 
Requested time limit is invalid (missing or exceeds some limit). Would you please take a look at this? Thanks in advance. 

```
[hongjing@comet-ln2 namd]$ sbatch -J glpc_1 --export nsys=1,cnt=2,cntmax=7 step6.csh
sbatch: error: bank_limit plugin: The requested time can not exceed the available balance.
Requested SUs: 17281
Allocation limit group SUs: 68545
Allocation limit user SUs: 68545
Allocation used group SUs: 53974
Allocation used user SUs: 39080
Allocation available group SUs: 14571
Allocation available user SUs: 29465
Allocation running/queued group SUs: 0
Allocation running/queued user SUs: 0
Allocation completed today group SUs: 0
Allocation completed today user SUs: 0
sbatch: error: Batch job submission failed: Requested time limit is invalid (missing or exceeds some limit)
```

The following script is listed for your reference. I think 48 hours should be okay as indicated in the website. 

```
[hongjing@comet-ln2 namd]$ cat step6.csh 
#!/bin/csh
#SBATCH --job-name="namd"
#SBATCH --partition=compute
#SBATCH --nodes=15
#SBATCH --ntasks-per-node=24
#SBATCH --export=ALL
#SBATCH -t 48:00:00

#This job runs with 15 nodes, 24 cores/node, total of 360 cores
#Load NAMD module
module load namd
```

Looking forward to hearing from you. 

Best,
hongjing
