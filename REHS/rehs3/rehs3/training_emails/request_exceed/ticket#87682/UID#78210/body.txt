Have trial allocation on Comet
was trying to run a job and keep getting time errors.
Expect job to to take ~16 hrs using 64 cores.  
have tried setting different using different node&core combinations as well as varying time from 17:00:00 to 03:00:00 and I still get output as shown below:

Would appreciate some help quickly - my thesis student could use the results in her presentation this Saturday!
