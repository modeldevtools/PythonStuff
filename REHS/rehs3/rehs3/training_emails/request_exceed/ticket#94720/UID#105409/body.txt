Attn: Marty Kandes


SLURM job 18956657 failed because the job exceeded its wall clock. When I look at the log file, I see only this:


<begin>

[llhenn@comet-ln2 OrdDat_clcc]$ cat OrdDat_clcc_settings_group2.Rout
mpirun: Forwarding signal 18 to job
[comet-22-04.sdsc.edu:14053] [[42221,0],0]->[[42221,0],1] mca_oob_tcp_msg_send_bytes: write failed: Broken pipe (32) [sd = 17]
[comet-22-04.sdsc.edu:14053] [[42221,0],0]-[[42221,0],1] mca_oob_tcp_peer_send_handler: unable to send header
mpirun: abort is already in progress...hit ctrl-c again to forcibly terminate

<end>


It looks like R didn't start at all. Checking the date stamps on the output files, they haven't been written to since Sept 4 or earlier. (If you want to check those, they are in /home/llhenn/Copula/OrdDat/OrdDat_clcc/rslts/rslts_OrdDat_clcc_phi_2.5_*.csv, where the number in the * position is 206 or less. A few jobs in that range were run when I was benchmarking Comet and will have much earlier date stamps.)


So it looks like the job just sat and burned nearly 7000 SU's without running anything.


Have I interpreted this correctly? Can anything be done to prevent it recurring? May I have a refund on those 6912 SU's?


Group 3 ran without problem in the same time period.


Thanks,

Lisa

PS I hope you had a good vacation!
