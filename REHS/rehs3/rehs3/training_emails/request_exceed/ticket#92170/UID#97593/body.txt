Hi,

I tried to submit my job on Comet, but I got the followings:

henry93@comet-ln2:~/RI/code/sparse_matrix_method$ sbatch RI_CA_2000_comet.slurm
sbatch: error: bank_limit plugin: The requested time can not exceed the available balance.
Requested SUs: 3025
Allocation limit group SUs: 50000
Allocation limit user SUs: 22000
Allocation used group SUs: 26326
Allocation used user SUs: 21901
Allocation available group SUs: 23674
Allocation available user SUs: 99
Allocation running/queued group SUs: 0
Allocation running/queued user SUs: 0
Allocation completed today group SUs: 0
Allocation completed today user SUs: 0
sbatch: error: Batch job submission failed: Requested time limit is invalid (missing or exceeds some limit)

I see that there are still plenty of SUs, but somehow the availability for me is only 99 SUs?

Thanks,
Henry
