Hello,

I want be sure about how the consumed SUs being determined. 

In the website 
GPU SUs = (Number of K80 GPUs) + (Number of P100 GPUS)*1.5) x (wallclock time) 

So if I am running a job for 24 hours using
gres=gpu:k80:4 and ntasks-per-node=24

that means I will consume 24*4 SUs. Is that correct?

Sanaa
