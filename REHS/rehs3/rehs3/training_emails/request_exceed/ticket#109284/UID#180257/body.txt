    Hello, 
    
    A colleague of mine wants to write a request for Comet startup allocation, but is having trouble determining how many SU’s to request. He knows he needs 4,000 CPU hours to run the program he needs to run, but does not know how many SU’s to request. Is there a direct conversion available anywhere? 
    
    Thank you,
