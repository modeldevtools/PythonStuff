I am the Co-PI of XSEDE allocation MCB160101 "Development of New Methods for Template-Based and Ab Initio Protein Structure Prediction and Structure-Based Function Annotation" for 2357143 SU on comet and 180000 SU on comet-gpu. We want to transfer the all the remaining SU from comet-gpu to comet, as our comet cpu SUs are all exhausted by now. However, in the XSEDE portal, we only have "renewal" option for this allocation. How can we transfer the SU from comet-gpu to comet?
