Hi, 

I am trying to figure out how many SUs were spent on some of my namd jobs that quit spontaneously. Since they didn't go through requested number of steps there is no final estimate in the end of the output file. Is there a command that would let me lookup SUs for a particular job number that I ran in the past? 

Thanks!

Olga
