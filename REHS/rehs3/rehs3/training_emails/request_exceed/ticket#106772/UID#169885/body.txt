Hi,

When I tried to submit a .sb file, I wasn't able to and the following error shows up:

sbatch: error: bank_limit plugin: The requested time can not exceed the available balance.
Requested SUs: 145
Allocation limit group SUs: 50000
Allocation limit user SUs: 1000
Allocation used group SUs: 4297
Allocation used user SUs: 991
Allocation available group SUs: 45703
Allocation available user SUs: 9
Allocation running/queued group SUs: 0
Allocation running/queued user SUs: 0
Allocation completed today group SUs: 395
Allocation completed today user SUs: 0
sbatch: error: Batch job submission failed: Requested time limit is invalid (missing or exceeds some limit)

I have just requested some new allocations (50k SUs), but I don't know why they still say I don't have enough SUs. Please let me know how I can tap into the new allocations when submitting my job.

Thank you,
Phuong
