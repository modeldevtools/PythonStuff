Hello,

I had been running jobs on our Campus Champion allocation but recently received my own start-up allocation. It appears the Comet-GPU allocation has not been updated with my current allocation. Is there something I should add to my submission script or alter in my XSEDE user-portal to update the allocation? The error message I receive from the scheduler is provided below.

Thank you,
Rory Henderson
