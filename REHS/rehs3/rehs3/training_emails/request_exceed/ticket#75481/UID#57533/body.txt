Hello, to whom it may concern. 
I am confused about the charging policy. 
The minimum charge for any job longer than 10 seconds is 1 SU. But my question is: if I run two jobs on one core, each job is 10 seconds, I will be charged for 1 SU or 2 SU. For example, if run 180 jobs on one core sequentially and each job is 20s. I wonder the SU usage is 1 SU or 180 SU?
