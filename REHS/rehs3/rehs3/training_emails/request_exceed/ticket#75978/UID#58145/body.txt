Hello,

Recently on Comet, I had the issue of the scheduler reporting incorrect
values of the requested SUs, and hence, barring anyone else from the group
from submitting additional jobs. I was informed of a scheduler mismatch,
which was being addressed at the time.

However I launched another job-array (located under
'/oasis/scratch/comet/adityak/temp_project/3D_focusing/triangle_test_fine')
and I am facing the same issue of not being able to submit additional jobs,
and the scheduler reports 1 million SUs being queued while my job-array
takes only about 40-50k. Could you please look into this to see if it is
another mismatch?

Regards,
Aditya Kommajosula
