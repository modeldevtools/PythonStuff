I think our project allocation has 46068.0 SUs remaining.  However, recently I was unable to run a short gromacs run requesting 2305 SUs.  I have a lot of files on the xsede system at the moment due to a backup located in /oasis/projects/nsf/cun105/pebenito.  Could it be that in the course of my run I will have requested more memory storage than xsede has alloted to me? Or is it that only a portion of the total allocation has been assigned for my use specifically and I have since consumed it all?  I am hesitant to erase duplicate files, I hope I can keep one backup on xsede at all times, but maybe I will need more memory for storage and to run additional jobs.
Thank you for your assistance,
