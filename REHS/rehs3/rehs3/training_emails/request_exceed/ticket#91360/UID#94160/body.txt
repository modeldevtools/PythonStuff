Hello,
I am currently running several projects using Comet cpu's.  I submitted five projects without an error and when I tried to submit a sixth project, I was given this error: 
sbatch: error: bank_limit plugin: The requested time can not exceed the available balance.
Requested SUs: 481
Allocation limit group SUs: 5000
Allocation limit user SUs: 5000
Allocation used group SUs: 2742
Allocation used user SUs: 2742
Allocation available group SUs: 2258
Allocation available user SUs: 2258
Allocation running/queued group SUs: 2765
Allocation running/queued user SUs: 2765
Allocation completed today group SUs: 0
Allocation completed today user SUs: 0
sbatch: error: Batch job submission failed: Requested time limit is invalid (missing or exceeds some limit)

I then tried to lower my time limit in my batch script to 20 hours, but I still received the same error.  My simulations require at least 20 hours to be successful.  However, my previous systems have a time limit of more than 30 hours and I did not receive an error when I submitted them.  

Any help is appreciated.
