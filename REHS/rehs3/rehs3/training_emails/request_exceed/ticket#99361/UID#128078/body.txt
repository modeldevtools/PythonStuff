I would like to request a reservation for Tuesday, 11/27 from 11am to 1pm eastern for 4-5 GPU nodes (whatever is available) for our class time. We are running calculations and would like the students to be able to run during the class period (from 11am-12:30pm). If needed, we can take fewer GPU nodes, but we do have roughly 35-40 students in the course.
