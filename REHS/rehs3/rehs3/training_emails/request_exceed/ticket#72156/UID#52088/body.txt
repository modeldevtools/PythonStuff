When trying to use sbatch to submit jobs with the command:

$ sbatch submittercomet.sh -p compute -t 00:30:00

I get

sbatch: error: Batch job submission failed: Requested time limit is invalid (missing or exceeds some limit)

but perhaps that's an error? can i not submit this way with my trial allocation?

Thanks,
Steve
