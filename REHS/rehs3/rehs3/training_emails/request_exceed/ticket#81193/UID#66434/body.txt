Hello,


I got a sample Sbatch script for running batched jobs from the  online comet tutorial  which I edited for running my program on sdsc comet. It appeared to be working but it later ended due to the time and resources I allocated for it. As a result, I increased the time and resources but it also did not finish running and the resource did run out. 

At current, i have no resources available and I am wondering if you could help me free up resources and also if you could guide me with coming up with a better Sbatch script for running the jobs. 

Thank you
