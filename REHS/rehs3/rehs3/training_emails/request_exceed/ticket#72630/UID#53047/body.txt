After looking at the output of my most recent test run, it's become apparent that we will probably need a lot more resources.  Based on the "typical" run I listed above, we will probably want to do at least 30 of these to complete the parametric studies we are considering.  I would therefore estimate somewhere around 300K SU, maybe higher.  Unfortunately, I wasn't able to get a more realistic set of baseline parameters setup to determine this until now, and we've missed the research application deadline for October.  Hopefully, we can get approval for an extension of our startup allocation to keep us running until the next allocation period.  Can you tell us what a typical limit is for startup application supplements?  After I work out a few more details, we will start running and use up our allocation relatively quickly...
