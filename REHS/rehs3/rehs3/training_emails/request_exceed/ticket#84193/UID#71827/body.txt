Hello,

I have been trying to submit a job to the cluster. However, I keep receiving the following error message:


sbatch: error: bank_limit plugin: The requested time can not exceed the available balance.

Requested SUs: 9

Allocation limit group SUs: 2989971

Allocation limit user SUs: 2989971

Allocation used group SUs: 2678277

Allocation used user SUs: 2632

Allocation available group SUs: 311694

Allocation available user SUs: 2987339

Allocation running/queued group SUs: 1324785

Allocation running/queued user SUs: 0

Allocation completed today group SUs: 372

Allocation completed today user SUs: 0

sbatch: error: Batch job submission failed: Requested time limit is invalid (missing or exceeds some limit)


I have received this error message consistently irrespective of the time limit I have specified (high or low). I have tried reducing the time to as low as 20 minutes, and have increased it to as high as 10 hours. I have also tried changing the memory limits in a similar manner. The job I am attempting to run isn't something that requires a great deal of time or memory, and I am unsure of how to proceed at this point. I would truly appreciate your guidance!

The path to my script is as follows: /home/idwivedi/temp_project/practice_project/kallisto/kallisto_index.sh

Regards,

Ila
