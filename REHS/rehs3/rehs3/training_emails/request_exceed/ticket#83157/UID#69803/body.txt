Hi,

When I submit ABAQUS jobs using the the attached submission file "abaqus-comet.sb", Comet will show these errors: 

sbatch: error: bank_limit plugin: Please set job time limit
sbatch: error: Batch job submission failed: Requested time limit is invalid (missing or exceeds some limit)

However, if I submit LAMMPS jobs using "lammps-comet.sb", it will run without any problem. 

Could you tell me what's wrong with my submission or account? My account is jchen153. 

Thanks,
Junbo Chen
