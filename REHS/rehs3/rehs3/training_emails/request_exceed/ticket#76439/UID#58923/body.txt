[System: Comet]
[Category: Allocations]
Dear administrator,

My name is Hao Jiang, and I have a recently awarded allocation on SDSC comet (charge # TG-CHE170059). The allocation is about 1.8 million SUs that are active until Sept 30, 2018. However, it seems to me the allocation is not available as I was unable to submit a job that will cost 576 SUs. Does this mean the allocation is not yet active?

Thank you for your assistance!

Best,

Hao
