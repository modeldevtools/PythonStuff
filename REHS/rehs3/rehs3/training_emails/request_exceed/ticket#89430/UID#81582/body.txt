Hi 
The group of which user - magsim is a member has around 1900 S.Us on Comet GPU. However, when I try to submit a job using this user  it shows the following error:

[magsim@comet-ln2 set2]$ sbatch -p gpu-shared -t 48:00:00 ms3.pbs rf_field_field.dat
sbatch: error: bank_limit plugin: The requested time can not exceed the available balance.
Requested SUs: 49
Allocation limit group SUs: 2500
Allocation limit user SUs: 100
Allocation used group SUs: 4
Allocation used user SUs: 0
Allocation available group SUs: 2496
Allocation available user SUs: 100
Allocation running/queued group SUs: 73
Allocation running/queued user SUs: 73
Allocation completed today group SUs: 8
Allocation completed today user SUs: 8
sbatch: error: Batch job submission failed: Requested time limit is invalid (missing or exceeds some limit)

I am new to this Supercomputer and none of the others have faced this issue. I tried looking for this at :
https://portal.xsede.org/sdsc-comet
but wasn't much help.
I am  attaching the batch file below. Do let me know as to the limit that magsim is facing (Is it :- Allocation limit user SUs: 100); and also is there a way to increase this limit. The project has only two ids that will actively use the allocations, so it would be helpful if both users make use of the allocation.

Regards, 
Aneesh
