Hi,
If I submit a job in Comet I am getting the following message:

sbatch: error: bank_limit plugin: The requested time can not exceed the available balance.
Requested SUs: 189
Allocation limit group SUs: 50000
Allocation limit user SUs: 1000
Allocation used group SUs: 30862
Allocation used user SUs: 930
Allocation available group SUs: 19138
Allocation available user SUs: 70
Allocation running/queued group SUs: 0
Allocation running/queued user SUs: 0
Allocation completed today group SUs: 18
Allocation completed today user SUs: 18
sbatch: error: Batch job submission failed: Requested time limit is invalid (missing or exceeds some limit)

I dont think I have used the 50,000 cpu hour allocated to me. I am not sure what is the problem.

Thanks,
Abhishek
