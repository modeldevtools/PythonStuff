Hello,

I have a program that splits up data for parallel processing (I didn't write the code). All the data files are not equal in size based on the way the data is split up. Therefore the jobs can take variable amounts of time, ranging from 30 min to 24 hours (one of them is still running) (see screen shot, each bar is one job and y axis is hours).

When I submit all jobs with max 48 hours I get an error message saying we don't have enough SUs to complete all tasks, even though most of them will not reach the max wall time specified.

Is there a way to get around this error? Or do you think we need to re-code how we split up the data? 

Joe
