Hi

We have an allocation of 60000.0 SUs in comet machine, the project name and number are: Multidimensional Modeling of NOx Formation in High Hydrogen Content Fuels Combustion in Gas Turbine Applications | TG-CTS170024.

When I submitted a job I got the following error msg or overusage:


[arhan12@comet-ln2 test8_150ppmNO]$ sbatch openfoam-run-restart.sb
sbatch: error: bank_limit plugin: The requested time can not exceed the available balance.
Requested SUs: 1153
Allocation limit group SUs: 60000
Allocation limit user SUs: 60000
Allocation used group SUs: 55575
Allocation used user SUs: 55575
Allocation available group SUs: 4425
Allocation available user SUs: 4425
Allocation running/queued group SUs: 3459
Allocation running/queued user SUs: 3459
Allocation completed today group SUs: 3
Allocation completed today user SUs: 3
sbatch: error: Batch job submission failed: Requested time limit is invalid (missing or exceeds some limit)
[arhan12@comet-ln2 test8_150ppmNO]$



It shows that I requested for 1153 SUs for the currently submitted job and I have 4425 SUs left. So it should work. Could you explain why it showed the overusage msg?

Also, I couldnt understand how 55575 SUs are already used, isnt it like when one run is completed, it will not be using that much of SUs? If this continues, I will be out of SUs if I keep running jobs.

I hope I could explain my question clearly. Please clarify my confusion.

Thanks
