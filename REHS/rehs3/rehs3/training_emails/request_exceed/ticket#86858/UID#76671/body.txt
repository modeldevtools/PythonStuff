Hi,

I'm trying to submit jobs on comet but receive the following error:

sbatch: error: bank_limit plugin: The requested time can not exceed the available balance.
Requested SUs: 25
Allocation limit group SUs: 1500000
Allocation limit user SUs: 1500000
Allocation used group SUs: 1282
Allocation used user SUs: 784
Allocation available group SUs: 1498718
Allocation available user SUs: 1499216
Allocation running/queued group SUs: 71586112
Allocation running/queued user SUs: 71586112
Allocation completed today group SUs: 702
Allocation completed today user SUs: 702
sbatch: error: Batch job submission failed: Requested time limit is invalid (missing or exceeds some limit)

It seems to be reading running/queued jobs incorrectly. Can you verify this?This has happened before and is a persistent error.
