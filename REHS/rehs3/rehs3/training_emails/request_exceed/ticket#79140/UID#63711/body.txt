Hi,

Today, I submitted several jobs to the queue, then canceled them because the time limit was too high before they even started. I attempted to submit them with a lower time limit, but it appears that the queue system still think I'm using those SU's in the queue. Below is the output of the error message I receive when attempting to submit a job:

 Allocation limit group SUs: 843160
 Allocation limit user SUs: 843160
 Allocation used group SUs: 786220
 Allocation used user SUs: 305083
 Allocation available group SUs: 56940
 Allocation available user SUs: 538077
 Allocation running/queued group SUs: 72469
 Allocation running/queued user SUs: 72469
 Allocation completed today group SUs: 642
 Allocation completed today user SUs: 642

As you can see, I should have around 54000 SU's available, but the queue seems to think I'm running/queuing 72000 SU's. Running the qstat command on myself shows that I'm not actually running any jobs. Is there any way you can correct this?

Thanks!
