Greetings, 

I was awarded 2500 GPU recently. I tried to submit a job and it said the Invalid account or account/partition combination specified. 

I looked my user portal and I guess I might request incorrectly. I need SUs for comet as I used previously. Would that be possible to make some changes? Thanks.
