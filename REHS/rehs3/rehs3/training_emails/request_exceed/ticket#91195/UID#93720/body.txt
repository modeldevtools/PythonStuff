I have a script at /oasis/projects/nsf/mia174/zqd/zqd01. When I try to submit it with sbatch, it complains: 

sbatch: error: bank_limit plugin: The requested time can not exceed the available balance.
Requested SUs: 48
Allocation limit group SUs: 2857143
Allocation limit user SUs: 2857143
Allocation used group SUs: 2585586
Allocation used user SUs: 88
Allocation available group SUs: 271557
Allocation available user SUs: 2857055
Allocation running/queued group SUs: 270590
Allocation running/queued user SUs: 0
Allocation completed today group SUs: 9281
Allocation completed today user SUs: 0
sbatch: error: Batch job submission failed: Requested time limit is invalid (missing or exceeds some limit)

and the job was not submitted. But from the above message, we still have 271557 SUs on our mia174 accounts.
