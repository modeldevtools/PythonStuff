[System: Comet GPU]
[Category: Allocations]
To whom it may concern,
I am an NSF GRFP Fellow, and I recently was awarded my own time on Comet GPU (TG-CHE190044). I am still on my PI's allocation, however, this is for a seperate project and I am to the point where I would like to begin using my allocation on Comet GPU. However, when I use the command "show_accounts" only my PI's allocation shows up (TG-MCB120097). Is there a lag time to the establishment of the other account? Also, the allocation with my PI has a working directory such as oasis/projects/nsf/uic317. How do I find out the similar path for my own allocation? I am new to this process and just want to make sure I run my jobs in the correct location and have them charged to the correct allocation. 
Thank you for your help,
Clorice
