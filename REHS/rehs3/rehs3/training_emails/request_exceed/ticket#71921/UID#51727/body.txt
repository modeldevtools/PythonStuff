Dear SDSC consultants,
My group is having difficulties using our comet-gpu allocation. We converted our regular Comet units into 40,000 comet-gpu SUs. From that point none of my group members have been able to use the units. All current users have been enabled to run on comet-gpu through the XSEDE portal. I would very much appreciate a quick resolution to this problem as I'm currently traveling outside of the US and the allocation is set to expire on Oct. 1st.

Many thanks,
Ivaylo Ivanov
