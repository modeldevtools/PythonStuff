Hello, 

I'm new to using Slurm, and I wanted to submit a job array with specifications as to how many cores are to be used per job, and I'm having trouble submitting the job. I don't think I understand how Slurm allocates resources per job, and I was hoping you could provide some help with submitting the job. 

I want to submit a 2,405 job array running a parameter sweep for a simulation. Each job is not computationally extensive, so I only want to allocate a single core per job with a maximum of 4GB of memory, so that I can optimize and take full advantage of my startup allocation. These jobs also run independent from one another. Here is part of how I was trying to specify this in my script:

#SBATCH --partition=compute
#SBATCH --ntasks=1
#SBATCH --array=1-2405%100
#SBATCH --mem=4G

This returns the error: 
"sbatch: error: Batch job submission failed:Invalid job array specification"

Reducing the job array down from 2,405 to 1,000 "--array=1-1000%100", I get the following error: 
"sbatch: error: bank_limit plugin: The requested time can not exceed the available balance. Requested SUs: 1153000 ..."

Therefore, I know I am requesting much more than I really want to and am doing something awfully wrong. Kindly, would you be able to recommend a way to organize my script so that I can specify the resources I need for each job? Thank you for your time.

Best,
Carlos
