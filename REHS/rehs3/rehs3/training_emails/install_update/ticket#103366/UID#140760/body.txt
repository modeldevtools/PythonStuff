Hi, I'm having the following problem.

1. I need to run a python3 code in parallel, it requires several libraries. 

2. My current solution is to have a singularity container with the required libraries in it. This container runs fine on multi-processors on comet except the performance is 20x slower than single-core (on my personal machine, it is 4X faster).

3. Suggested solution [1] to the problem is to import MPIPool from schwimmbad, but that requires mpi4py which a) is only available as a module for py27; b) cannot be installed in my container ("error: Cannot compile MPI programs." + "mpi.h: No such file or directory")

Any suggestions?

Thanks,
P.
