Hi,

I am hoping to gain assistance with installing the newest stable version of
Singularity(http://singularity.lbl.gov/docs-installation, version 2.4.2) as
a software module on Comet.  The only version of Singularity available as a
software module on Comet is 2.3.2.  As of version 2.4, an improved method
for building images was implemented(
http://singularity.lbl.gov/docs-bootstrap), and thus images created using
version 2.4+ are not compatible with singularity 2.3.2 .  On Bridges,
singularity 2.4.2 is available.  If it wouldn't be too much trouble, it
would be very useful to have Singularity 2.4.2 available as a software
module on Comet.  If this is the wrong place to ask for that, just let me
know!

Thanks,

Will
