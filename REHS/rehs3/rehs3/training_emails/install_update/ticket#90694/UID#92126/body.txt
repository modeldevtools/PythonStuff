I am trying to run some QChem jobs on Comet, and I've run into an error I can't figure out. The job quits with an error:


failed standard license check on comet-01-42.sdsc.edu SID 8CFAC8BA84


The error above came from SLURM job 17494371, if that's helpful.


I'm not sure what to do about this, and I'm hoping someone there will know more about this than I do.


Thanks,


Jordan Cox
