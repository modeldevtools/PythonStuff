Hi, I seem to recall that pip3 is a good version of pip to call when
installing python3 packages, but I can't remember where to access it.

Additionally, I'm trying to install this
<http://sdss-marvin.readthedocs.io/en/stable/installation.html> package,
Marvin, and pip isn't working for me. How do I access the --user command
with pip? It's not recognizing it for me.

Lastly, this package Marvin, calls files remotely given a url. Is there any
special permissions I need from XSEDE in order to do this?

Thanks!
