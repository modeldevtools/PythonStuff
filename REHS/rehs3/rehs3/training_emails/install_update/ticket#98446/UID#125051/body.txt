[Ticket created from XUP by trott]
[From: Sean Trott]
[System: Comet]
[Category: Software]
Hello,

I would like to be able to use several open-source Python packages for my research (e.g. numpy, scipy, sklearn, and others from the Anaconda package). Is there a recommended method to install these on my Comet account?

Specifically, I'd like to know whether I need to install them from source, or whether XSede / Comet supports something like Anaconda already.

Thank you!
Sean
