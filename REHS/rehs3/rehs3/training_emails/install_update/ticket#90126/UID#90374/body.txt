Hi, 
I am trying to install phonopy (https://atztogo.github.io/phonopy/install.html). But getting the following error:

"Original error was: /home/bdebnath/.local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/numpy/core/multiarray.so: undefined symbol: PyUnicodeUCS4_FromObject"

(The details are in the attached screenshot)

The setup files are here:  /home/bdebnath/common/phonopy-again

I am getting same error when trying to reinstall ShengBTE/thirdorder.py. The set up file is here: /home/bdebnath/common/ShengBTE-again/thirdorder
(The details are in the attached screenshot 2).

Both of them worked previously in COMET, now causing this numpy problem. I will really appreciate your suggestions and help on this.

Thanks in advance.

Bishwajit
