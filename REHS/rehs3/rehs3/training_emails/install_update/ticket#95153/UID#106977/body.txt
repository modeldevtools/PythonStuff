Hello,

I am trying to use Qbox (http://www.qboxcode.org/) on some of the XSEDE systems, but I cannot find some of the libraries that are required to use Qbox.  The required libraries are (from the Qbox website):

Qbox uses the following libraries
BLAS (or ATLAS) http://www.netlib.org or http://math-atlas.sourceforge.net
LAPACK http://www.netlib.org/lapack
BLACS http://www.netlib.org/blacs
ScaLAPACK http://www.netlib.org/scalapack
FFTW-2.1.5 or FFTW-3 http://www.fftw.org
Apache Xerces-C http://xerces.apache.org/xerces-c

I cannot find BLACS or Apache Xerces.  I can install Qbox in my home directory, but I would need these two libraries to use it.  Or, it would also be helpful to have Qbox installed on XSEDE systems.

Thank you,
Kelly
