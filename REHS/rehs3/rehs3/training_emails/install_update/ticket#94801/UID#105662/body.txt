I need to install a later version of Python than is available (2.6 to 2.7.3) but am unsure of the proper syntax to use. Additionally, I need to add a bin (Bowtie2) to the system PATH but am not sure if that is possible nor how to do it. I performed this on a PC before but do not have experience with completing it on the SDSC.
