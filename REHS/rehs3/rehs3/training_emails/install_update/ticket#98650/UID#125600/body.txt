Hi Chris,

I notice that there are a couple of software applications that I use that are not listed under 'module avail' within Comet.
- trimgalore
-rsem
-transdecoder
-edger

I'm not sure if there are not there, of if they are under a different folder and I just can't see them.
Also, if it is the case that they are not there, is there a way to get them installed, or should I install them within my allocation?
Thank a lot,
Ana
