Dear Mahidhar, 

Hi, last year, I requested installing the Trilinos package on Comet with specific options for our in-house flow solver. 
It worked great but when I tried to add a package and compile it again, it fails. 
The Trilinos package is installed by Mahidhar at the time. The cmake and all variables are changed now. 
Would you please help me to recompile the Trilinos on my account, “jseo”? 
There are directories “trilinos”, “install/trilinos”, “Trilinos_install” that you have used before. 
Basically I would like to add “—enable-ifpack-metis” when configure.
Thanks!

Best, 

Jongmin Seo
