Hey,
I am trying to use AztecOO package of Trilinos. I got the following error : fatal error: AztecOO_config.h: No such file or directory. In the available modules list it shows trilinos 11.12.1 version. Does this version of trilinos support AztecOO package? If not can it be installed?

Thanking You,
Rachit Shah
