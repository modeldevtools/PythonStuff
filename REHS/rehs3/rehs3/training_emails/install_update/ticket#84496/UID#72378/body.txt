Good afternoon,

In order to make some calculation with Quantum espresso, I need to use an extension that is not yet implemented in the regular QE, but it was sent to me by the developers. I would like to ask if is possible to install it.

I appreciate any help. I'm attaching the file with the extension.

Thanks in advance!
