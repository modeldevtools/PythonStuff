Would it be possible to make a newer version of git available as a module on comet? The current version is somewhat old:

~ git --version
git version 2.4.0

The newer versions have better handling of submodules and other features. This would be helpful to me. I had tried to compile git on another machine, and it took a very long time, so I suspect that you may be able to do this in a better/easier way. Also, this may be helpful to other users as well.

Thanks,
Shyam
