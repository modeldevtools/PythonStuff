I am trying to compile code that uses Lapack and I am getting an error. I am using the library in /opt/lapack/intel/lib and when I compile using mpif90 I get the following error:

/opt/lapack/intel/lib/liblapack.so: undefined reference to `zerbla_'
/opt/lapack/intel/lib/liblapack.so: undefined reference to `zggsvp_'

I googled this and all I could find was that this was an error in Lapack that has been corrected (it had a typo asking for zerbla rather than xerbla I think). Do you know anything about this or how to use Lapack on Comet? I tried the 'module load lapack' and that seemed to work except it does not see the library -lapack when compiling. That is why I has to point to the library itself. 

Thanks for any help you can provide.
