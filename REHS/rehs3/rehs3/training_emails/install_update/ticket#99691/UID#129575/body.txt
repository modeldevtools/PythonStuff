I am trying to install Atomic Machine learning Package ( AMP) - ( https://amp.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) on comet, but I am getting an error - thread.error: can't start new thread. 

I am using the command - pip install amp-atomistics (pip is from locally installed anaconda python) 

Please let me solve the issue. 

Thanks
