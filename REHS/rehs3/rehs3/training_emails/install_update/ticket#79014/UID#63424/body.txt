Hi, 
I am trying to install gpaw (https://wiki.fysik.dtu.dk/gpaw/install.html#), using the command:
python3 setup.py install --user 

However, it cannot find the -lblas -llapack (please see attached). I will really appreciate if you please help me in installing this. 

Thanks in advance.

The source file is here: /home/bdebnath/common/gpaw/gpaw-1.3.0

Regards,
Bishwajit
