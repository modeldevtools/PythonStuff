Dear Comet Admin,

I was wondering whether you could send me a compile script for NWChem? I have been using the default NWChem6.6 in the module. I need to couple NWChem with another molecular dynamics software, VENUS, for some of my research so I would need NWChem to be compiled with MODULE=geninterface and MODULE=venus.

Thank you so much for your help,
Rui
