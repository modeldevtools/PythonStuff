I tried to execute the instructions given on https://www.psc.edu/user-resources/software/anaconda for setting up custom anaconda environment. However, the packages get installed in home/.conda/pkgs  directory instead of pylon5. Because the space on home is just 10GB, the conda env is unable to run.
