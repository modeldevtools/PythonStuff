Hi Mahidhar:





It looks like we have an issue with projwfc module of the QuantumEspresso 6.1. as suggested by  the QEespresso-6.1.stderr



For the job 22323003 run from /oasis/scratch/comet/ddumettt/temp_project/seagrid_workdirs/PROCESS_bfc243f9-54ae-4075-9b92-118b5433c60c



The stderr contains the following..





+ mpirun -np 72 /share/apps/compute/qe/v6.1impi2015/bin/projwfc.x



forrtl: severe (61): format/variable-type mismatch, unit 33, file /oasis/scratch/comet/ddumettt/temp_project/seagrid_workdirs/PROCESS_bfc243f9-54ae-4075-9b92-118b5433c60c/HC_AmMiner_Wuensch_scf_1p00a_proj.projwfc_up

projwfc.x          00000000004057C9  Unknown               Unknown  Unknown







In a version I compiled I have the following for projwfc.f90 where the format was changed to open format.



!WRITE(iunproj,'(2i5,1x,a4,1x,a2,1x,3i5)') &

              WRITE(iunproj,*) &





Could you please check if the same is present on comet and perhaps recompile this module and update it.

Please let me know if you have any questions.



Thanks,

Sudhakar.
