Hello,

I am trying to install a program called Canvas but I can't seem to get it
running. The directions are here:
https://github.com/Illumina/canvas
They assume that you have .NET Core or mono but I am not sure if those are
available or I am able to download them. I have looked all over the
internet for some more instructions but I can't seem to find anything that
seems to help.

thanks,
Rob
