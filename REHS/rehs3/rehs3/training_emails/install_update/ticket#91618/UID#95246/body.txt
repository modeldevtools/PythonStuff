Hi Marty,

Sorry for the late reply. I couldn't reply to your
original message due to the spam filter on xsede.

I haven't been able to compile and run the binaries
according to your instructions yet. However, following
our chain of exchanges, I believe the main point of your
suggestion was that the wrapper "CUDA_SAFE_CALL"
surrounding the device count may be outdated for the
CUDA version(>5.0)  on Cometh? Since I have been
able to compile and execute the files on two separate clusters
with CUDA 7.5, I am not sure if the wrapper call would be the
real problem here?
In case you suggest there is a problem with the input
config parameters for Gin3D, I can have another look
into it and see if I run into the same problem on other
clusters using the same file.

Best regards,

Cheng
