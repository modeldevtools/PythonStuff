I am trying to compile WRF/Chem-KPP 3.9.1 on Comet.
It stuck because "No libfl.a in /usr/lib64"
in /oasis/projects/nsf/uok114/xhu2/Codes/WRFV3.9.1/WRFV3_kpp/compilewrfchemKPPoption20

See the relevant discussion in https://ruc.noaa.gov/wrf/wrf-chem/Users_guide.pdf
"
Likewise, there is one exception as well, the fast
lexical analyser (FLEX) library (libfl.a) will be needed if compiling the KPP chemistry
code. This library is commonly included with GNU bison and is freely available for
download at http://www.gnu.org/software/bison if it is not already installed on your unix
systm."

I wonder if you could install this library?
