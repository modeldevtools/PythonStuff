Ticket submitted on behalf of PI, please assign to SDSC. Chris Hempel

I am a user of comet and I was trying to run a python file which needs pytorch packages. However I could not find a pytorch image under the `/share/apps/gpu/singularity` directory. There are only tf, keras, and torch images. There is a pytorch folder under `/share/apps/gpu/singularity/images` directory containing `pytorch-gpu.simg`. I am not sure whether this is the built pytorch image. When I was trying to run my training code with the script in `e2.png`, I encountered an error reporting `can not find CUDA-capable devices`, as shown in `e1.png`.

I was wondering whether I made it wrong and how can I use pytorch on the platform. Thanks.

Best Regards,
Jianwen
