Hi, I am trying to use the hdf5 module on comet in my program. When I try to compile my program using gfortran (the version on comet is 4.9.2) the compilation aborts complaining that
"read-input.f90(32): error #7013: This module file was not generated by any release of this compiler.   [HDF5]
  use hdf5
------^
compilation aborted for read-input.f90 (code 1)
"
Which seems that hdf5 was built with a different compiler version. Can you please let me know which compiler version I need to load to use the precompiled hdf5 modules?
My program compiles fine on my local machine, where I have compiled hdf5 myself.

Thanks,
Inga
