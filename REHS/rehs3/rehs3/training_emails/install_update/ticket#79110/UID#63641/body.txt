Hello officers:

I am a graduate student in IGPP at SIO. Recently I install GMT and GMTSAR
which are necessary softwares in geophysics on the supercomputer Comet.
Since I have no permission to install them with package manager like
apt-get or yum, so I install *linuxbrew* in my home directory and use it
like *brew install*. However, I have bugs when I finally install hdf5 and
netcdf, two dependencies for GMT and GMTSAR. Could you please help me fix
the bugs to install all dependencies and GMTSAR in my *.linuxbrew* directory?
Thank you so much!

The link for installing GMTSAR: http://gmt.soest.hawaii.edu/
projects/gmt5sar/wiki
Attached is one of my installing bugs of hdf5.
My account is zej011@comet.sdsc.xsede.org

Best,
