Hello,

I submitted a few jobs over the weekend using an executable that I used toward the end of the last year. However, now I get an error saying 

/usr/lib64/libstdc++.so.6: version `CXXABI_1.3.8' not found (required by /oasis/scratch/comet/ysun022/temp_project/magma-2.2.0/lib/libmagma.so)

My submission script is attached. Any help fixing this is appreciated. Thank you!

Sarah
