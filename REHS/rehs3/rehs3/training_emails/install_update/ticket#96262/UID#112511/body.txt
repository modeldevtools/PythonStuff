Hi,

Quantum Espresso version 6.3 has already installed on comet, but I am repeatedly getting error running this for my spin polarized calculations (my calculations run fine with this version on local machine). Is it possible to remove this and reinstall it  again with the latest updated files? It would also be great if  you install the other version (6.1 is better) so that we can use different versions in need. 

By the way, If I want to install myself for my use, what modules do I need to load in the beginning? I would be happy and appreciate for your quick reply.

Thank You,
Hari Paudyal
