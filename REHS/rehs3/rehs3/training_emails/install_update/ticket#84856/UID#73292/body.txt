Dear Mahidhar: 

I downloaded the RASPA2.0 software. I uploaded the zipped binary file to my home directory and unzipped ([life000@comet-ln3 RASPA2-master]$. I read the installing introduction to follow the first step to go to src directory and try to configure the source code. It popped out:

[life000@comet-ln3 src]$ ./configure
-bash: ./configure: No such file or directory

I attached the install text file as your reference. Is there step I missed or mistake I made?

Best
