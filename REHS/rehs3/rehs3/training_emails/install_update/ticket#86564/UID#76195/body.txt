Hello,

I hope all is well. I am in need of creating a condor job that can run a shell script that makes calls to python3 and java. 

An example shell script can be found here: /home/npjoodi/freebase_experiment_8_cores/grid_search/freebase_scaling_experiment.shls

I am not too worried about running java since we already got a condor job running with for that, but I am not sure we can run python3. Also, the modules that I need in python, are the following:

import sys
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import re
import pickle as pickle
import random
import scipy.io as spio
import csv

Any help would be greatly appreciated. Unfortunately we have a deadline fast approaching.

Thanks,

Nick
