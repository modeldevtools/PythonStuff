Hi,

I have tried to make a singularity recipe which makes ubuntu container 
with paraview installed, and transferred that to comet and when I try to 
execute that I get the message "Kernel too old."
Paraview is a well established visualization tool which is used by many 
comet users. Can you please make a recipe file in comet which enables to 
build a container with paraview in it, with the support of GPU 
rendering.

Thank You.
Milinda.
