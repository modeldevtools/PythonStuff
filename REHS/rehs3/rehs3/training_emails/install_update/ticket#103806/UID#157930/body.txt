Hi
I would like to run several MD simulations on a comet. Recently we have developed a version of Amber in our lab which I would like to test it for my target MD simulations on comet. I am wondering how it is possible to run our own version of amber on comet?
Do I need to load any specific module/s before submitting the Job?

Thanks,
