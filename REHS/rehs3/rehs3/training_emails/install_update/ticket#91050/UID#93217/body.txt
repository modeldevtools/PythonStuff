Hello,

I've recently gotten a Comet allocation and was interested in using it to test the feasibility of using a motif finding software, MEME (http://meme-suite.org/), on some bioinformatic data. I know MEME used to have a server run through UCSD but it looks like it isn't installed as an available software.

Would it be possible to have it installed?

Thanks,

Sarah Lerch
