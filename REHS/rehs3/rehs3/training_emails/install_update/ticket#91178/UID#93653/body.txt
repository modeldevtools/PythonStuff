We would like to use the software Masurca, to assemble a large plant genome from PacBio reads. We currently use the SDSC Coment resources, but that system uses SLURM scheduling and Masurca is only built for batch submissions on SGE Grid systems. 

Is it possible to determine if any XSEDE resources have Masurca installed already, or utilize SGE Grid scheduling?
