When running an ubuntu18.04 based singularity image on Comet, I get "FATAL: kernel too old".

Are there any workarounds to this issue? Are there scheduled OS updates to Comet that may resolve this by supplying a new enough kernel?

This problem does not immediately impact our work as our existing ubuntu16.04 based images function. However, I would like to upgrade our toolchain to a more modern software stack.
