Dear colleague,

I had a miniconda in my account (ywfang), and now I want to use jupyter notebook implemented in it. I tried to run 'jypyter notebook' for several times, but all of them failed. It requires JavaScript, i.e., it requires a browser as Chrome. However, I didn't find the path where the browser is. Could you help solve this running problem of jupyter notebook for me? Thank you very much.
