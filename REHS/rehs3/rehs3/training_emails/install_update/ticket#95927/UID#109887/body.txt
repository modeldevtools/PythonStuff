Dear support team,

what is the most recent Cuda/MPI environment available (with GPUDirect support)?
As far as I was able to determine by going through the module system, Cuda 7.5 is the most recent version supported by a GPUDirect MPI library (mvapich2_gdr/2.2).
I also tried to OpenMPI environments, but the underlying Cuda driver version is 4.2.
I'm asking as my application uses Cuda Lambda expression, which were introduced in Cuda 8.

Thank,

Philipp
