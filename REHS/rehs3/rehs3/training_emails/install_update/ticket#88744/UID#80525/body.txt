Hello,

I am writing to ask about using a particular python library on comet. I
want to use pandas on python2/python3, but the module is not natively
available and I cannot seem to complete a local installation.

After running "pip install --user pandas", the installation completes
successfully, but when I attempt to import pandas, I get the following
error:

[chholtz@comet-ln3 profiling]$ module load python
[chholtz@comet-ln3 profiling]$ python
Python 2.7.10 (default, Feb  1 2016, 14:30:50)
[GCC 4.9.2] on linux2
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> import pandas
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
  File "/home/chholtz/.local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/pandas/__init__.py",
line 23, in <module>
    from pandas.compat.numpy import *
  File "/home/chholtz/.local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/pandas/compat/__init__.py",
line 421, in <module>
    raise ImportError('dateutil 2.5.0 is the minimum required version')
ImportError: dateutil 2.5.0 is the minimum required version

I am having difficulty installing this version of dateutil. Please let me
know if there are additional steps that I should take to fix this issue, or
if you need any additional information.

Best,
Chester Holtz
