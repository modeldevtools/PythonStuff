Dear Administrator,


Sorry for troubling you but I really need your help.


I was trying to run an executable on comet, but it shows an error says the


/lib64/libc.so.6


file version is incorrect. I see on comet it is 1.24 version, but my program requires 1.27 version. So I copied my 1.27 version from local to my

folder:


/home/baichen/bin/molarislib/libc.so.6


But now things became worse, I can't use ls, vi, etc. commands now, it gives error messages:


relocation error: /home/baichen/bin/molarislib/libc.so.6: symbol _dl_starting_up, version GLIBC_PRIVATE not defined in file ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 with link time reference


Could you please help me to recover my environments please? Also is it possible to run my program on comet? if not then I will have to look for other options. Thank you in advance!


Best,

Chen
