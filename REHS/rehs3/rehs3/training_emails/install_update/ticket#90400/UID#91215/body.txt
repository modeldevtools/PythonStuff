Hello,

I would like to have a python code that can detect when a file is done updating. I know of pyinotify, but it is a Linux-based code and it does not work with my computer. Therefore, I am trying to use it on the supercomputer. However, I am not able to install it via pip install pyinotify [1]. 

Can you please tell me how I can get around this, or if there is a special way to monitor file changes on comet that I can use?

Thank you,
Priscilla Kelly
