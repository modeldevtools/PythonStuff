Hello - 

A new version of RELION has been released - version 3.0. I am wondering if you can compile this software package for running on GPU nodes?

https://bitbucket.org/scheres/relion-3.0_beta.git

Ideally, I would also like this compiled in CPU, and, as you can see in the instructions

https://bitbucket.org/scheres/relion-3.0_beta.git

Having the choice b/w CPU & GPU would be advantageous for minimizing possible wait times and also to play to specific strengths of the code (ie despite being GPU accelerated, some tasks remain CPU only). 

Thank you,
Mike

PS - This is for incorporation into the COSMIC2 gateway.
