Hello,
I am currently trying to install R-3.4.4 using comet, but my ./configure command outputs this error “configure: error: zlib library and headers are required”. When researching how to remedy this issue, I have to download a new version of zlib and modify multiple files in the original R-3.4.4 download. As someone very new to bioinformatics, could you help me fix this?
Thank you,
Lauren Hamm
