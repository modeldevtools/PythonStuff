Marty,

It seem that we are pretty close to being able to run a simulation with all
your help, but my student and I have been trying to install pyICs -- needed
to the initial conditions for ChaNGa -- for several days.  I have tried
using pip or pip3 -- which works fine for pynbody.  pyICs relies on pynbody
because of ChaNGa's tipsy file format, for one. Below are a few error
messages -- apparently libraries are a problem.

Best,

johnny
