Hi,


I need to run Abaqus interactively on SDSC's Comet where I have a trial allocation. First I loaded the Abaqus module. Then I tried srun on the shared partition followed by the command 'abaqus cae' to launch Abaqus but it is not working. Are there any specific commands I need to use to run Abaqus interactively that I am missing?


Thank you,

Fariba Mohammadi
