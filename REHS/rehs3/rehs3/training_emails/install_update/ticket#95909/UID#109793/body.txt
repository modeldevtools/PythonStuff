Dear all, 

I am trying to install the FEM library DEALII, which requires Trilions to be installed. The precompiled versions on comet all seem to miss packages. 
For example, version 11.12.1 is missing Sacado other version miss other packages. 
Thus I wanted to install my own trillions version 12.12.1 using gcc-6.2.0. Everything seems to compile fine until the MueLu package, where I get the error
'Virtual memory exhausted: Cannot allocate memory'. I used make -j1 to be on the safe side.
Do you know this problem or could you offer some advice on how to proceed?


Thanks a lot. Your help is much appreciated.


Best regards,
Benedikt
