Hi, 

I would like to request some advice/help for installing a newer version of GPAW software. Last year Jerry Greenberg installed the latest version of GPAW for us on Comet. We need to use a new feature of the software which is only available in the current development version. Would you be able to provide us with assistance to install the development version of GPAW? 
Ideally we would want to upgrade the existing software to its latest stable (released) version and install the development version separately.

Thank you for your help
Talin
