I am trying to compile some code, and it requires an extensive list of prerequisite software. In the past, I have only done this on personal machines, where I have root privilege and can use sudo apt-get install to obtain all of the prerequisite software.

What is the correct procedure to do this on comet? My understanding is that I should be using custom installation directories, eg. my home directory. I have been trying to install the software using wget and the (ubuntu) source download urls, etc. However the dependencies seem endless, so I feel like I'm doing to wrong thing.

If I am to use wget, I'm also confused as to which version of the software to download (ubuntu, suse, debian, etc.)

Any guidance would be appreciated.
