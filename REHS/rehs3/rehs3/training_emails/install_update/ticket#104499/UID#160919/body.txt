Dear XSEDE:


Please install FastQ Screen


https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastq_screen/_build/html/index.html#


<https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastq_screen/_build/html/index.html#>it also requires a few other things (listed on the page), most of which you already have installed. I am unsure if GD::Graph is installed, however, so if not please add that.

Thanks,

Steve
