Dear Comet support, 

I was wondering if it possible to use the python bindings with openbabel on Comet? There is an openbabel module that can be loaded, but it does integrate with python, which can be tested by "import openbabel" in python. 

In my experience from building the package on my local machine, making from source with the correct flag generates a SWIG file in the python/site-packages path which connects them. This is happens automatically in some distributed binaries from openbabel http://openbabel.org/wiki/Main_Page)  such as the Ubuntu python-openbabel  package and are also readily available in conda environments through the anaconda cloud. 

The only alternative I have is to build a local version on comet (because it sets the bindings during the build) and place the bindings in my local python path. I want to try and avoid this because the build requires a whole laundry list of dependencies and permissions.

My ultimate wish would be to able to create my own conda environment which would simplify a lot of things for our workflows, for example this issue and also the lack of scikit-learn and a few other python packages we use frequently.

I'd be grateful for any advice you can give.

Best reads,
JP Janet
