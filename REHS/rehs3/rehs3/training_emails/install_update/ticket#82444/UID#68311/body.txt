When I try to run an abaqus job on comet, it exits with the following error:

 /opt/abaqus/6.11-2/exec/standard.exe: symbol lookup error: /scratch/pppaul/13945382/pppaul_sizeeff_main_3790/libstandardU.so: undefined symbol: _intel_fast_memmove

I have both the job file and the report specifying the error below. I was trying to look up on github, they said it's probably a mismatch between the intel compiler and the abaqus version. Could you please advise on the best way to fix this error?

Thanks and kind regards,
Partha
