Hi,

I hope you are doing well today.  I was wondering if it would be possible to install MAKER v2.31.9 (http://www.yandell-lab.org/software/maker.html) as module available on Comet?  I typically just install software not available as a module in my scratch space but given how many dependencies MAKER has and its use of mpi, it seemed like it might be better installed as a module.  MAKER is a very commonly used gene annotation pipeline and seems like it would be broadly of use to the genomics community.

Thank you for your consideration,

Jacqueline Doyle
