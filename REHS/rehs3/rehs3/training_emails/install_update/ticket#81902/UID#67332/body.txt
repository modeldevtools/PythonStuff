Hello,

I am currently in the process of performing scaling studies on COMET. I am getting the following error message upon execution of my code:

Invalid MEX-file '/home/sparshg/Nek5000/tools/amg_matlab2/cinterp_lmop.mexa64':
/lib64/libc.so.6: version `GLIBC_2.14' not found (required by
/home/sparshg/Nek5000/tools/amg_matlab2/cinterp_lmop.mexa64).

Is there a way in which I can install GLIBC_2.14 on COMET?
I would really appreciate it if you could help me out with this.

Thanking you.

With best regards,
