Hello,

I tried to run a job that calls a NetLogo program. I've already installed NetLogo on my account. However, when I tried to run the job, i received the error "error: Sorry, this program requires Java Runtime Environment 1.8 or higher"

Next, I wanted to check the java version on my account, but i received another error:

[alina@comet-ln2 ~]$ java -version
Error occurred during initialization of VM
Could not allocate metaspace: 1073741824 bytes

Would you please help me to install / load the correct Java environment?

Thank you,
Alina
