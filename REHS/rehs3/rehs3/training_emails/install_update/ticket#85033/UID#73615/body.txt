Hello,

I tried to run parallel programming through R after a couple of months, and now I see I can't run. Seems Rmpi package is not installed, which I cannot install on my own. Will you please fix the issue so that I can successfully rub the batch file /home/nsanyal/GWASinlps/ClzTOP/ClzTOP_anal/ClzTOP.Batch in parallel mode.

Thanks,
NS
