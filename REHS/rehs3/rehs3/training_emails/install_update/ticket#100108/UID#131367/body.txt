Attempting to upgrade ipf for comet form current running version (1.2-9) to latest version (1.4-3) and running into issues with installing / running IPF.

SDSC is unique in that we share login, scheduler and ipf nodes for both the comet and comet-gpu resources. As such we cannot (easily) install IPF with RPM and must run two separate setups of IPF, one for each resource.

I believe this will be easier continuing to run IPF triggered out of CRON and hope to accomplish that. Assistance is needed to complete a non-RPM based installation.
