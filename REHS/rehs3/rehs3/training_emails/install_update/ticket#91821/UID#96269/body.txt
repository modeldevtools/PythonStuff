Hi, I was trying to install and use tensorflow for python 3.6 on comet-gpu and I was wondering how I could do this. One of the requirements for tensorflow installation is cuDNN and it seems like this isn't available for comet-gpu. Could you please let me know how I can successfully install tensorflow? Thank you.
