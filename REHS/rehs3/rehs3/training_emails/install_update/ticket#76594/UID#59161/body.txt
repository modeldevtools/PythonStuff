Hello,
I was wondering whether there was a way to use TensorFlow (GPU) on Comet GPU. I'm unfamiliar with HPC, and while Singularity seems like it may allow me to install TensorFlow, I would still be missing cuDNN. The only cluster explicitely mentioning TensorFlow is XStream, but given how many people use deep learning in their work these days (that may very well be biased !), I would not be surprised if there was a way to run TensorFlow on Comet that I missed. Alternatively, is there a way for me to request a cuDNN + TensorFlow installation ? My lab was planning on submitting a research proposal, but most of the computing we would be doing would be machine learning, and would require TensorFlow. Thank you !
