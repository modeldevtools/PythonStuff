I am interested to use pyrosetta on the cluster. It looks like I will need to compile this myself since it's not installed already as a module, but getting this to work has been challenging. I noticed that rosetta/pyrosetta are available on another XSEDE system, so maybe you guys have some experience setting this up. Is it possible to create a pyrosetta module for comet as well? Any help would be greatly appreciated.
