Hello,

I've added a function to my software which I run using the Singularity image /home/hjohlas/singularity/ubuntu_openmpi.img.

This new function requires linking to the LAPACK library when I compile my UDF library, which I do from within a Singularity shell. However, I cannot find liblapack.so (or similar) in the existing image.

Can you please let me know the path to the LAPACK library in the image, if it's already there?
If not, can you please add the library to the image and then let me know the path?

As discussed in previous tickets (#69228 in particular), just loading the LAPACK module doesn't work in this situation since I need to compile the UDF library from the Singularity shell which doesn't support modules. 

As a side note, if I don't use the Singularity shell, I can successfully compile the UDF library once I've loaded the LAPACK module (but then cannot run the software with that UDF library of course).

Thank you,
Hannah
