Hi,
I want to install the python package scanpy (https://scanpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html). It needs python-igraph and louvain as dependent packages. It seems python-igraph need some library but the default image is lacking such as libarpack2, libigraph0v5. Could I install these package by using apt-get in the Singularity image? 
The image I am using is /oasis/projects/nsf/nji102/ttgump/singularity_image/tensorflow-gpu.simg
I copy it from /share/apps/gpu/singularity/images/keras/keras-tensorflow-gpu.simg
Thanks.
Best,
Tian
