Dear COMET support team,

I'm running deep learning model on Singularity pytorch image. I'm having 
trouble installing third-party python packages. Although most of popular 
python packages such as `numpy` have been preinstalled, others, e.g. 
`hickle`, `filelock` and `cachetools`, remain uninstalled. Is there any 
way to install them? Thank you so much for suggestion.

Yours sincerely,
Kaiwen Wu
