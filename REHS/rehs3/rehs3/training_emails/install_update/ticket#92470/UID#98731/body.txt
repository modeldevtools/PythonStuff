Hi,

I'm having compatibility issues with Python libraries that require CUDA. I'm trying to install Tensorflow but have had problems with numerous installation methods:
1) Installing a pre-built package from anaconda: the package installs its own CUDA-9.0 but the system's NVIDIA drivers for the GPUs are too old for this CUDA version
2) Installing a pre-built package from pip: the package does not install its own CUDA, but fails when being imported in python: "/lib64/libc.so.6: version `GLIBC_2.14' not found" (max is 2.12)
3) Compiling from source: the compiler (bazel) also fails due to the GLIBC requirement.

Would it be possible to either a) install CUDA 9.0 or later (and a compatible cuDNN), with drivers, as a system module or b) somehow fix the core gnu library problem?

Thank you,
Jonathan
