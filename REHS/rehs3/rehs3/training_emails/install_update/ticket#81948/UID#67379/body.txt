Hello,

Please help on Tensorflow and Keras.

I see a singularity image at
   /share/apps/gpu/singularity/sdsc_ubuntu_tf1.1_keras.img

I tried it, and it works using just CPU.

When I attempted to use a gpu (P100), it did not work for me.
That is, I used the --nv flag, but it seems to
require some other directory. I probably do not know
how to use this image properly with a P100 gpu. 
Would you please direct me to any appropriate documentation?

If the above image cannot be used with a gpu, is it 
possible to request a singularity image for Tensorflow with Keras
that anyone on Comet may use?
I tried to build it myself, but again it seems to
require root for the build.

Thank you very much for all your help.
