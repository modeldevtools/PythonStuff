Hello,

I was trying to get the cxx version of netcdf-4 working for use with my project, and was running into a bit of a problem. When I tried pointing the configuration file to the existing netcdf-4.3.2 module I got an error message saying that the base netcdf package needed to be installed with netcdf-4 enabled. Has it not been, or have I pointed to the file incorrectly?

Perhaps other researchers have asked to have the cpp version of netcdf, and you already have a pipeline for having people set up netcdf-cxx; if so just let me know. Thanks for your help!

Best,
Daniel
