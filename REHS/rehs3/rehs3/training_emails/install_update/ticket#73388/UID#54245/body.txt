Dear Sir/Madam


I am interested in using the 'singularity' functionality in comet. For example, I would like to run the attached python code (with the keras module)  on a gpu. However, I have not managed to do this so far. If you could be give me a set of instructions/manual to do this it would be great.


I have done the following steps so far.


  1.  cd  /share/apps/gpu/singularity
  2.  module load singularity
  3.  singularity shell sdsc_ubuntu_tf1.1_keras.img         (I get "WARNING: Non existant 'bind path' source: '/scratch')
  4.  python temp.py                    ( I get "OpenBLAS blas_thread_init: RLIMIT_NPROC 1024 current, 2048 max")
  5.
ulimit -u 2048
  6.
export OMP_NUM_THREADS=2
  7.
python temp.py
  8.  I get the following error (
    from keras.model import Sequential
ImportError: No module named model
)

So I am guessing I need to update keras in the singularity but I am not able to do this with  pip install upgrade etc.

Your help will be greatly appreciated.

Kind regards,
Anand
