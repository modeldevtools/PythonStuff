Hello, 

I am trying to install darshan and I have already compiled and installed both darshan_runtime and darshan_utils. When I run my code I get the following error:
mpiexec: error while loading shared libraries: libmpich.so.3: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory

and I am not sure what is the problem. I checked my rpath and it is:
(py3) [mkhoshle@comet-14-02 ~]$ objdump -x /home/mkhoshle/installs/darshan/lib/libdarshan.so |grep RPATH
  RPATH                /home/mkhoshle/miniconda2/lib

But I donot have a miniconda2 environment. I have a minconda3 environment. 
Do you know what can be my mistake?

Thank you,
