[System: Comet]
[Category: Software]
Tensorflow is a software for Deep Neural Network applications. It performs very well on GPUs. While CUDA Toolkit 8.0 is already installed on COMET, the other dependencies for Tensorflow such as cuDNN v6.0 is not yet installed. Would you be able to install these dependencies and the software on COMET?

Thanks,
Alireza
