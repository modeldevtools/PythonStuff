I am getting the following error when I try to run pandas on Comet:

[jsale@comet-14-02 climatechange]$ python3
Python 3.5.0 (default, Feb  1 2016, 14:14:54)
[GCC 4.9.2] on linux
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> import dateutil
>>> import pandas
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>

    raise ImportError('dateutil 2.5.0 is the minimum required version')
ImportError: dateutil 2.5.0 is the minimum required version


I have tried to explicitly upgrade dateutil with:

pip3 install --upgrade --user python-dateutil==2.8.0

However, it still installs 2.4.2.
