Hi,

I am trying to install an electronic structure package called BAGEL (https://nubakery.org/quickstart/installation_guide.html#downloading-the-source) which has a few prerequisites as you can see in the link. If I have checked correctly, I think comet has Boost version 1.41. However, I need a newer version than 1.53 to install this program. Is it possible for you to update that or should I just do it locally? 

Any help will be appreciated.

Thanks.

Pratip.
