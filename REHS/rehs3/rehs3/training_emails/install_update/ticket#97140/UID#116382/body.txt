Hi, 
I wanted to do some plots with Python and Basemap on python.
I loaded the python library. However, when I try to load the Basemap module, 
I got the following message:
ImportError: No module named mpl_toolkits.basemap

Iâ€™m not sure what I should do. Do you have such a module installed somewhere ?
thanks, 
best
Lionel
