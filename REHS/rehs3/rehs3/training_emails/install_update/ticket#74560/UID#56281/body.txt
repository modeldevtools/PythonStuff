Hello,

I am new to Comet. I would like to use tensorflow and keras (with
tensorflow back end) on P100s. What would be the best way to go about this?

I found the following page on singularity in comet:

http://singularity.lbl.gov/singularity-on-comet

No mention of tensorflow on the site though.

Thanks,

Kumar
