Hi 

Is there any module for PHDF5 in comet. I see a module for hdf5 but nothing for phdf5. I have built and installed phdf5 and h5py from source myself. In the login node, I am able to run my code but when I submit my job it fails because it can not import h5py. Do you know what is the solution for this problem?

Thanks,
