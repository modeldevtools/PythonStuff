I am trying to use the NETCDF4 Fortran API routines on Comet by using the netcdf module - however, it seem the Fortran libraries have been built without NETCDF4 support as can be seen using nf-config that shows: 
  --has-nc4   -> no
which I understand means the Fotran NETCDF4 API is not enabled - hence I am being unable to use flags like NF_NETCDF4 etc. to enable parallel-IO using NETCDF4 API.

Please let me know if I would need to install the library myself to be able to use the NETCDF4 Fortran API and if so, could I have the installation procedure for the currently existing netcdf module on COmet.


Thanking you,
Sutirtha.
