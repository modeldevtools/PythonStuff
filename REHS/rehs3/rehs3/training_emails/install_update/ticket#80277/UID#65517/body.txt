Hi,

Since I am wondering how I could run my TensorFlow program in the Comet cluster,
I was looking for any instructions in the website but failed. 

If that is not available, is there any other Neural Nets framework available?
Or can I install that in my ~/local directory?

Any help would be appreciated.
