I am trying to execute pyspark.sb located at /home/aroy18/recovery_with_rule/script/SPARK/pyspark_v161

job id = 16568745

This is an example shared on /share/apps/examples/SPARK/pyspark_v161/ 
There are two .out files. pagerank-pyspark.16568745.comet-12-27.out is the one I got and the other one was previous run. The .out file shows that it went on some import error
TypeError: namedtuple() missing 3 required keyword-only arguments: 'verbose', 'rename', and 'module'
