Hello,
         I want to do QM/MM calculation with GROMACS2016 and ORCA 4.0.1, but in order to do that Gromacs needs to be recompiled with ORCA. Please have this custom built in the following directories:
(i)   /home/c0nn0r
(ii)  /home/sturzo
More information about the installation and example files with an older version can be found in this link: http://wwwuser.gwdg.de/~ggroenh/qmmm.html .
I have also reached out to the GROMACS user community about if the newer versions are compatible with ORCA and they had this to say:
-----------------------------------------
It seems that ORCA compatible with latest GROMACS if I correctly understand meaning of "//". Look in ?CMakeCache.txt file in the installer.

//QM package for QM/MM. Pick one of: none, gaussian, mopac, gamess,
// orca
GMX_QMMM_PROGRAM:STRING=None
-----------------------------------------
If you have any other questions please feel free to ask me or my student sturzo(email: s.turzo@vikes.csuohio.edu)
