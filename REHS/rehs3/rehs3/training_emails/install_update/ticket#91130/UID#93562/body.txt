Dear colleagues,

I installed pymatgen (version 2018.6.11) module in my account by anaconda, however, I got an error when using 'import pymatgen' 

Here is the complete error information in python shell:
ImportError: /lib64/libc.so.6: version `GLIBC_2.14' not found (required by /home/ywfang/miniconda3/lib/python3.6/site-packages/pymatgen/util/coord_cython.cpython-36m-x86_64-linux-gnu.so)

I found the version in COMET is 2.12, which couldn't be used by the latest version of pymatgen. I am wondering could you help install GLIBC_2.14, or could you provide me a work-around so that I can make pymatgen work?

Thank you very much for your help.
