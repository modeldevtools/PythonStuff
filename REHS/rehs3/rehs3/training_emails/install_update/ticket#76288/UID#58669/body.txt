Hi,

I used to use cuda-7.0 that I installed by myself in my folder to run gpu codes. Now after theano moved to the libgpuarray backend, I can`t use theano anymore. Since gpurarray always returns the file "libcuda.so" no such file or directory. I do see in the module file there is cuda and cuda/7.5 cuda/8.0, also there are cuda in /share and in /usr.  I tried to use module load cuda but still has the same problem. Please let me know what are the steps to set up theano on Comet with its new backend. Thank you. 



Best,

Cheng-i Wang
