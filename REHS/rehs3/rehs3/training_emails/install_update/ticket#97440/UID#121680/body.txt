Hello

1. Can you please inform me which modules I need load to use python 3 on comet? I could only get python 2 or 2.6 so far.
2. I wanted to use the nco command "ncap2", but it is not available ("ncap" is but "ncap2" isn't) with the modules I loaded at least. Is it available somehow?

Thanks,
Aviv Solodoch
