Hello,
 I am having trouble using the gnu compiler. I am running a program in which I specify the runstyle as gnuparallel. I get n error message that says I cannot use gnuparallel unless I install gnu parallel. But I have module gnu loaded. 

please find the error message below:

which: no parallel in (/opt/pgi/linux86-64/17.5/bin:/opt/gnu/gcc/bin:/opt/gnu/bin:/opt/mvapich2/intel/ib/bin:/opt/intel/composer_xe_2013_sp1.2.144/bin/intel64:/opt/intel/composer_xe_2013_sp1.2.144/mpirt/bin/intel64:/opt/intel/composer_xe_2013_sp1.2.144/debugger/gdb/intel64_mic/bin:/usr/lib64/qt-3.3/bin:/usr/local/bin:/bin:/usr/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/opt/ibutils/bin:/usr/java/latest/bin:/opt/pdsh/bin:/opt/rocks/bin:/opt/rocks/sbin:/opt/sdsc/bin:/opt/sdsc/sbin:/home/maccarth/bin)

You can not set "-runstyle =gnuparallel" because your system dose not support the commands: parallel.
To support parallel, you have to install the GNU parallel from https://www.gnu.org/software/parallel/

The path to the batch script I am running is:
/home/maccarth/I-TASSER5.1/I-TASSER5.1/I-TASSERmod 

and the script is
submit_itasser_comet.sh
