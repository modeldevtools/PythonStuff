Hello,

   I would like to request the installation of tensorflow for GPU on the Comet cluster, binded to python3. The tensorflow version should be at least 1.8, being the latest version (1.12) the best. It is also worth noting that my application only works for python 3. If possible, I would recommend installing python 3.6.4.

Thanks in advance,
Willian
