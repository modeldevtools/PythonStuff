Hello,

I am trying to install CGAL in my home directory, but I seem to get some
errors:

*cmake: /usr/lib64/libstdc++.so.6: version `GLIBCXX_3.4.18' not found
(required by cmake)*
*cmake: /usr/lib64/libstdc++.so.6: version `CXXABI_1.3.5' not found
(required by cmake)*
*cmake: /usr/lib64/libstdc++.so.6: version `GLIBCXX_3.4.14' not found
(required by cmake)*
*cmake: /usr/lib64/libstdc++.so.6: version `GLIBCXX_3.4.15' not found
(required by cmake)*
*cmake: /usr/lib64/libstdc++.so.6: version `GLIBCXX_3.4.20' not found
(required by cmake)*

The installation directions can be found here (section 12):
https://doc.cgal.org/latest/Manual/installation.html

Could you kindly advise me on how to proceed with this? (As long as the
right libraries are found, the installation is straightforward as I've done
on other machines)

Thank you,

Regards,
Aditya K
