Hi,

Our lab uses an application that interfaces with Trilinos as one of the linear solver packages. However, we don't really need all the default Trilinos modules and using the default module produces several errors related to PyTrilinos and it appears that the developers of Trilinos are still trying to fix those. 

In the meantime, one of our lab mates, Jongmin Seo (xsede id: jseo) has reached to out to HelpDesk and had you installed a custom version of Trilinos that works with our application. Is there a way that the Jongmin's version of Trilinos could be accessible to all our lab members, under the PI: Alison Marsden (xsede id: amarsden)?

Thanks,
Vijay
