Hi --

I'm trying to run mmseqs2 on comet, but having a bit of trouble getting it installed/compiled.

https://github.com/soedinglab/MMseqs2

The static builds provided by the developers run into an error message "FATAL: kernel too old". I haven't run into this error message before, so I'm not sure if this information about the binary will help:

[saladi1@comet-14-01 static_sse41]$ file bin/mmseqs
bin/mmseqs: ELF 64-bit LSB executable, x86-64, version 1 (GNU/Linux), statically linked, for GNU/Linux 3.2.0, not stripped

I can install it through conda, but if I understand correctly then the binary won't be built with avx2, which the developers say provides a pretty big advantage in terms of speed and it looks like the processors on comet support them.


Compiling with the following modules loaded:
Currently Loaded Modulefiles:
  1) use.own             3) parallel/20160422   5) gnu/4.9.2           7) cmake/3.9.1
  2) tmux/2.2            4) singularity/2.6.1   6) fastqc/v0.11.8      8) openmpi_ib/1.8.4

and following the authors sort of simple instructions runs into errors during `make`. I saved the output of cmake and in case it would help figure out what's going on here.

directory: /home/saladi1/apps/mmseqs2/git/build
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RELEASE -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=. ..  > output.cmake.txt 2>&1

make > output.make.txt  2>&1

The errors include:

/tmp/ccw6bSPq.s:684: Error: no such instruction: `shlx %r11,%r9,%r9'
/tmp/ccw6bSPq.s:693: Error: no such instruction: `shlx %r10,%rcx,%rcx'

/tmp/ccw6bSPq.s:758: Error: no such instruction: `shlx %rsi,%rcx,%rcx'

When I search this online, I'm pointed towards binutils versions as being the issue, but this is where I sort of am not sure where to go next.

Do you think you might be able to help?

Thanks a ton,
Shyam
