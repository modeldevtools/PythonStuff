[System: Comet]
[Category: Software]
I use Sandia National Laboratories DAKOTA toolkit for my uncertainty quantification pipeline (this automatically manages how many simulations I need to run for a given tolerance).

Other XSEDE systems have DAKOTA installed as a module. I was wondering if you would consider installing DAKOTA as a module on your system.

The most recent releases are here: https://dakota.sandia.gov/download.html

If this isn't possible, I can compile it in my personal directory.

Thanks,
Casey
