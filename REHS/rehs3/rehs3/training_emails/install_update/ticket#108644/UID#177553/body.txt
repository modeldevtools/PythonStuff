Hi,


I see that GNU compiler on COMET is quite old, and it can't find a module for newer GCC:


[oleksanf@comet-ln2 src]$ gcc -v
gcc version 4.9.2 (GCC)

4.9.2 is almost 5 years old, and it lacks proper C++11 support.  Is there a way to use a newer GCC compiler on COMET?

Kind regards

Oleksandr Frei
