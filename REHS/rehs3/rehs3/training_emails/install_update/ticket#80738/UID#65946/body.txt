Hi,

Could you help me with loading the numpy module? It isn't listed in the modules, and loading scipy didn't help. I get the following message when I try to load the numpy module in a python script:

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "setup.py", line 2, in <module>
    import numpy as np
ImportError: No module named numpy

Best,
Irem
