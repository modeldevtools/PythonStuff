Dear Staff of Comet,



I need root privilege to install the most popular machine learning packages as below:



  *   TensorFlow: https://www.tensorflow.org/install/install_sources

  *   MXNET: https://mxnet.incubator.apache.org/install/index.html

  *   Peddale: http://www.paddlepaddle.org/docs/develop/documentation/en/build_and_install/build_from_source_en.html



Currently, I cannot even run “git clone” command to download those source code on comet.

I knew @Mahidhar helped me install Gunrock before. It would be excellent if you can reroute this email to Mahidhar!!!!



Thank you very much,

Hang
