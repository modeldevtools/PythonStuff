Hi,

I am trying to install a code. When I run ./configure, the code tries to download Python dependencies but failed and provided an error message: "Missing Python dependencies".

However, the dependencies are actually in the package, located under `/home1/02505/hujs/CitcomS-2.1.0-adjoint/python/pythia-0.8.1.15-py2.6.egg`. Therefore, the code does not need to download them. It only needs to find them.

The configure file is a bit long, which is beyond what I could understand. Could you please take a look and fix the problem? The code is in the directory `/home1/02505/hujs/CitcomS-2.1.0-adjoint`. Thank you!

BTW, the code can be installed on other machine, such as Blue Waters. In fact, it was installed on Stampede1 too. Somehow, I can not install it on Stampede2 any more. I tried to set the CFLAGS to add the path of the dependencies, but it does not work.

Regards,
Jiashun Hu
