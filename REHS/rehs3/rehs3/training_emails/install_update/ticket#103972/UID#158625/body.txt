Hello,



I work as a Research Programmer at the National Center for Supercomputing Applications. I was recently given access to use Comet on the XSEDE cluster. My work on Comet primarily involves benchmarking a tool using Spark. The Spark version required by the tool is (2.4.x) greater than the current default (1.5). The Scala version required (2.11 or higher) is also higher than the default. I shall be really glad if you could help me install these upgraded versions on Comet.



With Regards,
