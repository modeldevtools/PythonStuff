Hello, 

I'm trying to run tophat but i'm constantly running into a libboost issue; 

/opt/biotools/tophat/bin/segment_juncs: error while loading shared libraries: libboost_thread.so.1.65.1: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory

And I have an unrelated question, would it be possible to install Salmon for RNA-Seq mapping? https://salmon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/salmon.html

Thank you in advance, 

Kristina
