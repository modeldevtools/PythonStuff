Hi,

I want to run a series of simulation on ANSYS Fluent. I have contacted ANSYS Inc. and they are willing to support with installations and license setup on COMET. Is it possible to install the software on COMET servers ?
Or do I have to figure out some sort of package containers ?

Regards,
Haris
