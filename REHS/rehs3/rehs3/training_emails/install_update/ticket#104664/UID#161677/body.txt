Hi,

Basically, I was trying to install a package in a singularity container and I was getting some errors that I (wrongly assumed) were because the pip installation was very old. I upgraded pip via the recommended command and now I believe I broke pip and I don't know how to revert everything to how it was before.

A sample error I'm getting now:
Singularity tensorflow-v1.12-gpu-20181218.simg:~/Learning-to-See-in-the-Dark> pip install scikit-image
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/usr/bin/pip", line 9, in <module>
    from pip import main
ImportError: cannot import name main

I've tried switching from this particular singularity container to another, but it is still broken.

Thanks in advance.
