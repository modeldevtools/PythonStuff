Dear Mahidhar,

I hope you are doing well. I am going to start working with an open source program library called DAMASK (https://damask.mpie.de/Home/WebHome). Therefore, I am kindly requesting you to install the package in my home directory in Comet. There is a complete explanation for how to download, install and configure the package in their website. For the part 4 of the installation (Boundary value problem solvers) the program can have interface with three different solvers MSC.Marc/Mentat, Abaqus and Spectral solver. I need to work with the second and third ones, namely Abaqus and Spectral solver and Mentat can be avoided. 

Thank you very much for your help and I look forward to hearing from you. Please let me know if you needed any further information.

Best regards,
