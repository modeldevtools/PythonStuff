Hello,

I am using software that requires CUDA 8.0 or higher (preferably 9.2). When I submitted a batch of jobs, all except one failed with the message: 

notice(2): The NVIDIA driver only supports CUDA versions up to 7.0, but HOOMD was built against CUDA 9.2

However, one job is currently running successfully on Tesla P100-PCIE-16GB  56 SM_6.0 @ 1.33 GHz, 16280 MiB DRAM, MNG. 

Do you have any suggestions for how I can access GPUs that will allow me run my code?

Thank you!

Alyssa
