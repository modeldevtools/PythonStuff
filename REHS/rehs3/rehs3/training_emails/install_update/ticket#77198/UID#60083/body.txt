Hi Mahidhar,

I am trying to run some python code that will do some automated post processing on model output, but the scipy module does not seem to be working ("ImportError: No module named scipy"). Is there a way to fix that? Also... in case COMET does not support the other modules I need, what is the best way to install them? The post-processing code is named 'alpha_output.py' and it is in the SWAN directory in temp_projects.

Cheers,
-Walter
