Hello all, 

I was assigned to do some work in comparing to different MPI compilers and I have few questions :

1- I want to use OSU Micro-Benchmarks 5.5 MVAPICH2 does comet support that?
2- I was trying to install OSU Micro-Benchmarks 5.5 on comet userspace and I am getting permission denied? any ideas.


thanks,
Aymen
