Hello,

We were trying to use a software tool that we compiled on CentOS 7 which does not run on the Comet GPU infrastructure since it is running CentOS 6. Recompiling the software has proven rather difficult so we were wondering if there are any machines available in the Comet GPU space that are running CentOS 7 or if you have had any prior experience with this sort of problem.

Thank you,
Michaela Buchanan
