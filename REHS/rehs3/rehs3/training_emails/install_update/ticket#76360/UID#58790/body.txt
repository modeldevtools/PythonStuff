Hi, I have been trying to install the boltztrap, located in the following folder:
/home/bdebnath/common/4-boltzTrap/boltztrap-1.2.5

However, I an getting several gfortran error. (the makefile is in /src). 
Just to mention, I have used same makefile for Stampede and it works there (/work/03489/tg827881/common/0-boltztrap-1.2.5/src)

I will appreciate your help in installing this package in COMET. Thanks in advance.

Regards,
Bishwajit
