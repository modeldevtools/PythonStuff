I am trying to install the fluids/plasma library BOUT++ on my home directory. This library requires netcdf and/or hdf5. Both of these are available as modules. However, the configure program for BOUT++ still fails. For hdf5, the problem seems to be the absence of the h5cc script. For netcdf, configure says that nc-config does not have C++ support. I'm not sure how to fix this; I didn't have this issue when installing BOUT++ on my laptop. I've attached the outputs of the configure program. Note that specifying the location of hdf5 did not help.
