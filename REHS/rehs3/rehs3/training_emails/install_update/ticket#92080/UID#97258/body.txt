Dear System Admin,

I need to use a customized Gromacs for my own research. I first compiled Gromacs-5.1.4 and compared its performance with the public one (module load Gromacs). I was only able to get about 50% of the performance ~60 ns/day vs ~ 110 ns/day on my test calculation. 

I used the following module for my compilation:
  1) gnu/4.9.2             2) intel/2016.3.210      3) intelmpi/2016.3.210   4) gromacs/2016.3        5) cmake/3.9.1

The cmake command was:
CC=mpicc CXX=mpicxx cmake .. -DGMX_MPI=ON -DGMX_DOUBLE=ON -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/home/rusun/local -DGMX_BUILD_OWN_FFTW=ON -DEXTRA_C_FLAGS=-fPIC -O2 -DGMX_DEFAULT_SUFFIX=OFF -DGMX_BINARY_SUFFIX=_514_along -DGMX_LIBS_SUFFIX=_514_along -DEXTRA_C_FLAGS=-xHost

Would you please let me know what I was doing wrong? It would be great if you could share a compiling script.

Thank you,
Rui
