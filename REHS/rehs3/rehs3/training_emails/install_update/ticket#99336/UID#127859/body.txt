Hi,

I am writing this problem under "accounts" as I am getting no confirmation email back when I write it under "software".

I am trying to install the boost library for installing an electronic structure package BAGEL (https://nubakery.org/quickstart/installation_guide.html#downloading-the-source) as boost is a prerequisite for that package. It needs boost version 1.53 or higher where the boost version in comet is 1.41. Is it possible to update it globally in comet for you? or should I just try to do it locally. 

I am trying to install boost locally at the moment. But, for some reason the BAGEL installation still does not recognize it.

Any help will be appreciated.  

Thank you.
