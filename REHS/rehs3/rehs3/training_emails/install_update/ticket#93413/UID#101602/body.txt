Dear XSEDE expert,

I recently want to run several calculations using OCRA code but the code manual said that I must have openmpi 2.0.2 version installed to run the code in parallel. Can I find it somewhere on comet? If no, Is it possible that I install the right version in my home directory? Would you please explain a bit more (e.g. dynamic lib, mpd stuff) so that I learn the situation better? 

Thanks,
Yonghui
