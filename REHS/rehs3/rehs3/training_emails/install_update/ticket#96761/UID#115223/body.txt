Hello,

It seems the only (GNU-compiler configured) CUDA-aware MPI implementation available (MVAPICH-GDR) was configured and compiled with CUDA 7.5 (incompatible with Pascal, it seems). Would it be possible for a newer version of MVAPICH-GDR (or CUDA-aware OpenMPI, whichever) configured with CUDA 9.2 to be installed? Or if not, would I be able to build and install it myself locally? (I have successfully installed CUDA-aware OpenMPI on a 2-GPU, single node system, but have no idea how the process would differ on a cluster.)

Thank you very much!
Zach
