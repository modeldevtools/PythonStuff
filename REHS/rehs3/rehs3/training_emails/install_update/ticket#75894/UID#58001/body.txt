Hello,

I'm trying to compile gromacs 5.1.4 with plumed 2.3 patch on comet, but 
it seems that none of the compiler/mpi on the machine works, due to a 
variety of problems. I was wondering if someone on the IT staff could 
compile the program for me. This is a pretty common software combination 
for molecular dynamics so I'm sure other users will find it useful as 
well. Thanks in advance.

Best,

Lu
