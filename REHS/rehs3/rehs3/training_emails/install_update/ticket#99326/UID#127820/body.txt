Hi,

I am trying to install an electronic structure package called BAGEL (https://nubakery.org/quickstart/installation_guide.html#downloading-the-source)  which needs the BOOST libraries as a prerequisite. It also needs boost version 1.53 or higher. I checked that comet has a boost version 1.41. Could you please update it globally if possible? I am also trying to do it locally. However, for some reason the BAGEL package is still not able to find the libraries properly even when I set the path and failing at the ../configure step.

Any help will be appreciated.

Thank you.
