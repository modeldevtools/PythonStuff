Hi ,

I am trying to install CAScode0.3x from https://github.com/prisms-center/CASMcode/tree/0.3.X,
since this is the latest version and has the python package 'prism_jobs' for job management using slurm.
I am getting the below error while trying to install 0.3x :
~~~ Error loading casm libraries ~~~
find_executable('ccasm'): None
Could not find 'ccasm' executable. 

I am following the instructions given at :
https://prisms-center.github.io/CASMcode_docs/pages/installation.html
and also at the INSTALL.md file available in the code.

I would be very thankful if someone can compile the code. 

Best Regards,
Anshuman
