Hi XSEDE Help,



Please excuse the novice-ness of this inquiry – I’m a new Campus Champion and have not yet had a chance to become thoroughly familiar with the platforms and processes used for submitting and running jobs. I’m hoping this will be an easy ask for those of you who are experts in this field! As many of the Champions with expertise are currently attending SC18 and not responding to inquiries, it was suggested that I contact you with my questions.



We’ve had 2 recentl inquiries from researchers who left us with the following questions:

Researcher #1:



  *   An individual in bioinformatics is seeking advice for use of Comet resources and specifically is seeking an example batch job script for any of the bioinformatics tools. She had seen the examples scripts (https://portal.xsede.org/sdsc-comet#running:jobscripts) but was hoping to be pointed to something more bioinformatic specific.

  *   In addition, this individual was able to upload her data to Oasis, but was not able to determine how to ‘connect’ Comet to Oasis (is it as simple as a CD command?).

Researcher #2:



  *   A new XSEDE user asks: Is there a way to install Python 2.7 and specific Python packages to the Comet computing environment, and to analyze data using this software?

  *   And also, what is the best place to store data long-term (when using Comet), and what is the best place to store data that is currently being analyzed?



I’d be happy to talk this through by phone if that would be easier. Any help is much appreciated (and I plan to attend a 2-day workshop as soon as possible!) – please let me know if additional information is needed :)



Best,

~ Cyd
