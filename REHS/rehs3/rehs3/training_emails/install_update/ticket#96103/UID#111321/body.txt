Hello,

I was wondering if I could request that an upgraded version of CP2K be installed on COMET. The current version is 6.1 (released June 2018) while the installed version is 4.1 (released October 2016). They have a lot of tutorials and scripts for the newer versions which are useful. Additionally, it seems that the program efficiency has increased as well. 

Thank you,
