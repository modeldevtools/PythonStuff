Is it possible to have Comet install the ANGSD software package at root level? (https://github.com/ANGSD/angsd). It requires htslib and lzma libraries, the latter of which I'm having trouble installing locally. The software is increasingly used for population genomic inference. 
If not I understand.
Thanks!
