Hello, 

I am working with the UC Berkeley Campus Champion and a Post-Doctorate student, Lazar Supic, running a custom Singularity container with TensorFlow-GPU on Comet-GPU. The CUDA toolkit and driver versions need to be updated in order to successfully run our image and have Comet-GPU be optimized for CUDA processes.

Can Comet-GPU CUDA toolkit and NVIDIA drivers be updated to: 

CUDA 9.0 with driver version 384.xx? 

Thank you and please let us know if this is feasible or if there is an alternative approach / solution. 

-Oliver
