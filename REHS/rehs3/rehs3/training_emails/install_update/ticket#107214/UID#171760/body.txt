Hi, 

I am trying to run a fortran code on Comet. In my local environment (THECUBE Cluster at Cornell with CentOS 6.3) the model compiles and runs successfully with gfortran 6.3.1, but runs into issues with previous versions (e.g. 4.4.7).
The default version on Comet is 4.9.2 and even though the compilation produces no errors, the model does not run. 
From module avail it seems that that's the only version? Is there any way this could be addressed?

Thank you!
