Hi,

I kept having a problem of mapping using STAR.
I was trying to figure out the problem and found one post pointing of the compiling part.

https://github.com/alexdobin/STAR/issues/193

Will it be possible to try to re-install STAR 2.5.3a again and see if I can resolve the problem?

Thank you very much for your help.

Mariko
