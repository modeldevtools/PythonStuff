I was trying to set up a virtual environment on Comet so I can install specific versions of the atomic simulation environment we use to visualize molecules.  When I tried to install the virtual environment I realized that "virtualenv" is not installed on the Comet system.

I was able to do this on Stampede2.  Is there a way to set up a virtual environment on Comet?  If virtualenv is added to the available programs on Comet I should be able to install this without any issues.
