Dear administrator of Comet,

I need to use interactive mode, srun --partition=debug --pty --nodes=1, on Comet, to post process some of my big simulation data. I really like to use python to visualize it.

I want to know if it's possible to install some necessary python package on comet cluster, like matplotlib, matplotlib.pyplot, scipy, and scipy.ndimage

I try pip install  matplotlib but it turns out my inaccessible permission.

Thanks for your kindly help.
