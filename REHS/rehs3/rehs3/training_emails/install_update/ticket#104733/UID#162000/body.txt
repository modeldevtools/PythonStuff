Hi,

I've been trying to use the user-plumed library with lammps, which doesn't appear to be installed with the default build of lammps on comet. I've been trying to compile a separate version of lammps with the library installed, but it doesn't seem to be working-- I suspect the problem is that the version of python on Comet is 2.6, as when I try installing it on my personal computer with python 2.7 everything works fine. Right now, I get a number of warnings when installing the plumed library initially, and when I try to build LAMMPS I get the error:

../fix_plumed.cpp(37): catastrophic error: cannot open source file "plumed/wrapper/Plumed.h"
  #include "plumed/wrapper/Plumed.h"

Any ideas on how to solve this problem? Thank you!

Cheers,

Andrew
