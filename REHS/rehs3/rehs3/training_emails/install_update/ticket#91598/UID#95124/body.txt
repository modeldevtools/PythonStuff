Dear administrator,

Can you help me to install a new version CP2K on my account home directory or default for all accounts? I found the computational speeds are different with different versions, So far, it is CP2K 4.1 on Comet. Could you please install CP2K 6.1 or 5.1? Thank you so much!

Best,
Lingling
