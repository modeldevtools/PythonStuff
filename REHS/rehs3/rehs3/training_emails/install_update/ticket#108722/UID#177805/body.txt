Greetings,

I am having difficulty opening a Jupyter Notebook to work with while I am
using an interactive GPU Node:

Workflow to get GPU node:

1). srun -A sio134 --partition=gpu-shared --pty --nodes=1
--ntasks-per-node=6 --gres=gpu:k80:1 -t 03:00:00 --wait=0 --export=ALL
/bin/bash
2). module purge
3). module load singularity
4). singularity shell
/share/apps/gpu/singularity/images/tensorflow/tensorflow-v1.12-gpu-20181218.simg

At this point, I attempt to open a Jupyter Notebook

jupyter notebook --port=8888

get the error:

bash: jupyter: command not found

I believe I was told previously I could add modules, like Jupyter I needed
by

pip install --user  jupyter
or
pip3 install --user jupyter

The pip3 install seems to install jupyter, but doesn't change the above
error "bash: jupter: command not found "  while just pip yields the error

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/usr/bin/pip", line 9, in <module>
    from pip import main
ImportError: cannot import name main

I can successfully open a jupyter notebook in the can by using my locally
installed miniconda3:

/home/gmooers/miniconda3/bin/jupyter notebook --port=8888

However, this seems to conflict in some way with the can and my TensorFlow
is only able to read the cpu, not the gpu I requested (see image 1)

I can open an Ipython notebook once inside the can via:

ipython notebook --port=8888

However, my understanding is that ipython is an older version, and I'm not
sure that everything in the jupyter notebook will be properly converted in
ipython.

Is there another way I can install/access jupyter once inside the can so I
can open up a jupyter notebook to work with?  Or something wrong in the way
I am currently trying to install jupyter?

Thank you for your time.

All the est,
Griffin
