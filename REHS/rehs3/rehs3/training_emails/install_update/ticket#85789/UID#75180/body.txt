[System: Comet]
[Category: Software]
I would like to run a C code on comet that depends on the following libraries:

GSL: https://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/doc/html/index.html
QHULL: http://www.qhull.org/
CFITSIO: https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/fitsio/fitsio.html

I believe that they are packaged in CentOS.
Are these libraries loadable or could they be made available?

Thanks,
Miguel
