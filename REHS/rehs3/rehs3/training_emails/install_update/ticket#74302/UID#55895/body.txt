Hello,

I am wondering if you would be able to update the RELION2 installation to the latest version? There have been a number of important bug fixes since this was installed that are necessary for using the code, otherwise there is a possibility of jobs randomly crashing and/or artifacts in the structures that we calculate. 

Thank you, 
Mike
