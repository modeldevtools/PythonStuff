Dear XSEDE-OSGer,

I have trouble with executing the jobs I submitted to OSG. For some reason there are a great portion of jobs have failed due to not able to find 'python3'? (The error goes as '/usr/bin/env python3 no such file or directory')

Therefore I tried to create a virtual environment using virtualenv and following the tutorial on python virtual environment as: https://srcole.github.io/2017/01/03/osg_python/. However, it fails to install any libraries such as numpy/scipy. 

I was wondering what is the problem and is there any way to fix this? Many thanks for your help in advance,

(p.s Attached a err. file for the failed job)
Best,
Yingru
