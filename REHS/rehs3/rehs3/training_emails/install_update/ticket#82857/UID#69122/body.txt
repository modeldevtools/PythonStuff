Hello,
I am trying to install MEEP on comet (https://meep.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Installation/#guile-recommended) but I am running into issues. 

First, when I try to install libctl I get this, even though I have guile loaded:
In file included from ctl.c:27:0:
ctl.h:30:24: fatal error: guile/gh.h: No such file or directory
 #  include <guile/gh.h>
                        ^
compilation terminated.
make[3]: *** [ctl.lo] Error 1
make[3]: Leaving directory `/home/pkelly74/install/libctl/src'
make[2]: *** [all] Error 2
make[2]: Leaving directory `/home/pkelly74/install/libctl/src'
make[1]: *** [all-recursive] Error 1
make[1]: Leaving directory `/home/pkelly74/install/libctl'
make: *** [all] Error 2

And, I would like to use BLAS, but I only see BLAST. Is this a similar type of code? Or do I have to install BLAS myself?

Thank you,
Priscilla
