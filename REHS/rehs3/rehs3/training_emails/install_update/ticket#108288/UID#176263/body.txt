Dear sir,

Will it be possible that you install cmake in the comet servers. I'm working on a project where the software requires cmake for installation. I tried downloading the code, building and running but faced a problem at the end as I was not permitted to write a file in the user directory. I tried following the instruction from "https://gist.github.com/1duo/38af1abd68a2c7fe5087532ab968574e".

Best Regards,
