The only Python installation available in Comet is Python 2.7. Is it possible to install Python 3? Perhaps the Anaconda distribution of Python 3 which includes the Scientific Python Stack and the PyData stack. Additionally, the Anaconda Python distribution is linked against MKL. Python 2â€™s EOL is coming in close at 2020.
