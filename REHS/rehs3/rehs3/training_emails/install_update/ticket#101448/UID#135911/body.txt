I am attempting to install fastp locally, and am running into an issue with the 'make' step. I am running into the same error

/oasis/projects/nsf/uoa104/agwamba/fastp/src/writer.cpp:43: undefined reference to `gzbuffer'
collect2: error: ld returned 1 exit status
make: *** [fastp] Error 1

I tried to uses the popular fixes to the Makefile found from searching this error in Google, and none has worked for me so far. Please advise.

Thank You,
Kennedy
