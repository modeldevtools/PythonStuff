Hi,
I am trying to complie gromacs2016.4 on my home account. I used the cmake but it looks like that cmake verion I need for compilation is not late enough.
The command I use is:

cmake .. -DGMX_BUILD_OWN_FFTW=ON -DGMX_MPI=ON -DGMX_GPU=off  -DGMX_BINARY_SUFFIX=_cuda -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/home/sarashteh/programs/gromacs-2016.4/

And the error I get is:

CMake Error at cmake/gmxTestCXX11.cmake:114 (message):
  This version of GROMACS requires a C++11 compiler.  Please use a newer
  compiler or use the GROMACS 5.1.x release.  See the installation guide for
  details.
Call Stack (most recent call first):
  CMakeLists.txt:164 (gmx_test_cxx11)


I am not sure it the problem with cmake or gcc, or .. . Can you please help me with it?

Thank you,
Shima
