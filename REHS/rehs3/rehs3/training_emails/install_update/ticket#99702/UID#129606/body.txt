Dear helping staff,

I am testing my code on Comet (comet.sdsc.xsede.org) with a trial account. (I will soon apply for start-up allocation, but now I wan to test my scripts first) I want to use Python+Numpy toolbox, but it appears Numpy module, has not been installed, and the version of Python is 2.6, which is a bit outdated. I would appreciate it, if Python2.7 (together with Numpy, Multiprocessing, Pandas modules) and Python3+ could be installed, and plus it would be even better if Tmux (terminal multiplier) could be installed too.

Thanks a lot,
Renai
