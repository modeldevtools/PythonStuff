Hi folks,

I'm a new XSEDE user with a new allocation through Comet. I'm interested in using the program ipyrad (http://ipyrad.readthedocs.io/installation.html). It's intended to be installed locally, and I've previously been able to do this on other clusters I've used. It's installed through conda, which I've also installed locally in the past. 

I appear to be able to install conda following the directions in the link above, but when I attempt to use it (e.g., to install ipyrad or to update conda), I receive the following error: "Solving environment: failed". The full error report is attached here. 

It seems likely that I'm doing something very wrong, or that I don't have permissions to install these programs locally. Any advice you can provide would be very helpful. If Comet isn't the right place for me, I'd also appreciate any advice you can offer re: what to do next.

Cheers,
Todd
