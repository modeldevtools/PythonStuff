Hi Mahidhar:

I run the RASPA2.0 software for a example test last week. It was shown that the energy is different from the example in manual.
In the manual trouble shooting part it is said that:
"The results are different on different machines We have come across one compiler-error: gcc 4.3.0 using
optimizations ”-O3” and ”-O4” generated wrong code. Gcc 4.3.2 has resolved this bug."

I checked that the current gcc verison is 4.9.2.

I looked at the install procedure. It is  mentioned about the gcc alternatively as the following:

Usually (when recent automake and autoconf versions are installed), it is enough to do
1. make clean
2. ./configure --prefix=${RASPA_DIR}
3. make
You can use the ’CFLAGS’ environment variable to set compiler options and ’CC’ to set the compiler.
For example, for a gcc compiler one could use
export CFLAGS="-Wall -O3 -ffast-math"
export CC="gcc"

The installation of RASPA2.0 is simple as following 2 and 3. It works for running and completion.

Is it possible related to the gcc?

Best
