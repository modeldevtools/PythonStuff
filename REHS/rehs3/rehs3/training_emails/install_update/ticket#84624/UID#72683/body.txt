Dear Staff,

I am a new user of comet, and I would like to test the performance of the
latest version of gromacs 2018. My experience is that
compiling gromacs 2018 with Cuda 9.0 gains 50% speedup comparing to
gromacs 2016.3. So, is it possible to install Cuda 9.0 using module? Thanks.

Best,

Chungwen
