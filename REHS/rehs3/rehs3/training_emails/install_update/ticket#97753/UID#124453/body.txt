Hello,

I am getting this error when I am calling a meep singularity [1], which I believe is telling me that a certain module call isn't be recognized. Can you please verify for me that the current meep singularity, found here [2], is version 1.4 or higher?

If it is, then I do not know why it isn't being called correctly because I am using a meep tutorial to call this module [3]. I ran my other code without this module and there was no problem.

Thank you for help with this issue. I am finally transferring the fine-tuned work I have to comet, so I really will need to use this singularity daily from this point on. 

Priscilla

(FYI, I worked with this issue before with Martin Kandes, in case he isn't the one reading it.)
