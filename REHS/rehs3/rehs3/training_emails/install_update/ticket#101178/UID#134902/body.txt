The current version of Q-Chem installed on COMET is 5.1.1, however, as of December 3rd, 2018 the newest version is 5.1.2. The jobs that I want to run using Q-Chem require a bug fix that was released as part of the 5.1.2 update. Is there a plan to update the version of Q-Chem on COMET to the newest version?
