This is Dr. Chao Dong, from Department of Chemical Materials & Engineering at New Mexico State University. I am trying to run molecular simulation with RASPA software and install it in remote cluster.

When I followed the first step  "clone ssh://raspa2@itsaio.science.uva.nl/~raspa2/RASPA-2.0.git"  in PUTTY interactive window.

It asked me to provide password like this "raspa2@itsaio.science.uva.nl's password: ".

However, in the manual of "RASPA 2.0: Molecular Software Package for Adsorption and Diffusion in (Flexible) Nanoporous Materials", there is no password mentioned as shown in attached image.
Is it possible for comet to provide the installing password?

Best
Chao
