Hi, Marty! Thanks for being there! I apologize for using an old subject line.

Before I wrote to you, I tried library(‘ggpubr’). The error message I got at first was simply:



Error in library("ggpubr") : there is no package called 'ggpubr'

Execution halted



Then I tried:



install.packages('ggsci')

install.packages('cowplot')

install.packages('ggsignif')

install.packages('ggrepel')

install.packages('ggpubr')



The error I got was:



Installing package into '/opt/R/local/lib'

(as 'lib' is unspecified)

Warning in install.packages("ggsci") :

  'lib = "/opt/R/local/lib"' is not writable

Error in install.packages("ggsci") : unable to install packages

Execution halted



So, it didn’t like the ggsci package! Next, I simply ran



install.packages('ggpubr’)



This time I got:



Installing package into '/opt/R/local/lib'

(as 'lib' is unspecified)

Warning in install.packages("ggpubr") :

  'lib = "/opt/R/local/lib"' is not writable

Error in install.packages("ggpubr") : unable to install packages

Execution halted





So it seems that this time I didn’t specify the location into which the package has to be installed! Hope this gives you some clues!

Chris

Chris,



I didn't have any problem starting the installation with a simple 'install.packages('ggpubr') command. However, it did eventually fail with these dependency errors [1]. Is that what you saw as well?
