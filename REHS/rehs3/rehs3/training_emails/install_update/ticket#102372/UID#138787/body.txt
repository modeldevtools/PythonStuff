I am trying to install a python package called yt (see: http://yt-project.org/). I am able to install it with conda, but it's not working as it should (in particular, it's not reading my plugins file and I can't call certain functions without my scripts breaking). 

I have had my username on Comet for some time now, and I'm worried that I have some conflicting python installs. I really would like to work with python 3.6 or greater. It would be great if someone could help me out with this. 

Please let me know what you need from me.
