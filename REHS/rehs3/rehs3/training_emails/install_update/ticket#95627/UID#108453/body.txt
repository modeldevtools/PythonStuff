Hello, 

I'm attempting to use Python on Comet, but running into a few issues. One of the largest is that I'm unable to import scipy with Python/2.7.10: 

>>>import scipy
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
ImportError: No module named scipy

I was also wondering if there's a way to install other libraries (or Python 3?) that are important for my workflow (joblib, for example) and have them usable when running on a compute node. 

Any help would be much appreciated. 
Thanks,
Meg Fowler
