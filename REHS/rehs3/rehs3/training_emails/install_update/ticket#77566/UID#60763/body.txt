Hi, 

I’d like to do some diagnostic using python on comet.

I’m used to do it on my local machine where I first installed the following:
yum install python-devel.x86_64
yum install python-matplotlib.x86_64
yum install scipy.x86_64
yum install netcdf4-python.x86_64

I tried to launch a script on comet, but I got the following error message:

ImportError: No module named netCDF4

meaning that I don’t find the netcdf4-python library.

I’m not sure whether it’s already installed or not, and if installed how
to load it. Same apply for the other python library I installed on my local machine.

In my script I simply do: from netCDF4 import Dataset

I would appreciate any help, 
thanks,
cheers
Lionel
