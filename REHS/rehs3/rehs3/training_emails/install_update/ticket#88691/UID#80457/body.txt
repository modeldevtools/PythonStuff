Hello!

I am trying to use singularity on XSEDE Comet with images served from the
singularity hub, however that is not possible at the moment, because the
singularity version installed on comet is too old.

Pulling images from the singularity hub results in the following error:

[csadorf@comet-ln3 scratch]$ singularity pull
shub://csadorf/singularity-recipes:cuda8
Progress |===================================| 100.0%

gzip: ./csadorf-singularity-recipes-master.img.gz: not in gzip format
ERROR Error extracting image, cleaning up.
ERROR: pulling container failed!
[csadorf@comet-ln3 scratch]$

See also: https://github.com/singularityware/singularity/issues/1089

Would it be possible to update the singularity version on comet?

Best,
Simon
