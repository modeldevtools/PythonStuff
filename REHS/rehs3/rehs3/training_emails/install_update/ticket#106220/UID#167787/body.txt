Dear XSEDE Support Team,

I am going to use some special functions of NAMD 2.13. I found it hasn't been installed yet. Could you please help me compile NAMD 2.13 on Comet with the Shared-Memory and Network-Based Parallelism (SMP) builds. Similar to the Linux-x86_64-ibverbs-smp (InfiniBand plus shared memory, no MPI needed) version on its website? And also could you please tell me how to run a smp NAMD simulation appropriately. 
 
Best,

Rong
