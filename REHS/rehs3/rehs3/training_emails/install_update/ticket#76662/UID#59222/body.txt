Hi Mahidhar,

I hope you are doing well! I am trying to install SWAN (ocean wave model uncoupled) on COMET, but am having a bit of trouble. I am following the instructions in the link below, but when I get to the "make mpi" step, I get the error "make: *** [mpi] Error 2". Perhaps you can help? The path to the code is /oasis/scratch/comet/wtorres/temp_project/SWAN 

http://swanmodel.sourceforge.net/online_doc/swanimp/node6.html

Thanks!
-Walter
