I was trying to run Tensorflow and Keras on Comet GPU nodes. But I encountered two problems. 1) cuda in /usr/local is kind of outdated. I was hoping for cuda 9.0 for the latest version of tensorflow. But this is not the major issue here. 2) cuDNN is missing in /usr/loca/cuda/lib64. I was given error saying "libcudnn.so.6: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory" when I tried to import tensorflow package. Some related information can be found here https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/12416. I am hoping for a solution to this problem so that I can run my python script on the cluster GPU.

Is it possible to install cuDNN version 6.0 or 7.0 onto the system? Thank you!
