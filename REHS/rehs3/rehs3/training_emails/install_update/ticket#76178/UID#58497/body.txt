Hello,

I might have to use the CGAL library (https://www.cgal.org/download.html)
for some of my code on Comet. Would it be possible to have a version of
this installed in the root directories (a simple 'sudo apt-get' should do
it)? I seem to have issues building from source.

Thank you,

Regards,
Aditya K
