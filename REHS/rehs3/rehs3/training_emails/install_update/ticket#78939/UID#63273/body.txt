Hi,

I am trying to compile some source code I have. I need an access to a GFortran version >=4.8. I loaded the GNU compiler using "module" commands but I point to an old version (the 4.69 I guess)> I tried to point to the 4.9.2 using :

module purge
module load gnu/4.9.2
module load gnu openmpi_ib

...but without success. It seems I still point to the old one. I am probably doing something wrong but can't figure what exactly... 

Thank you for your help.
