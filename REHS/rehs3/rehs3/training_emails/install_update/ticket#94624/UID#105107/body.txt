I have need of Python 3 on Comet. I tried installing from source to my own directory (/home/tburgin/glycosynthases/171110_TmAfc_d224g/eps/Python3) but frankly I'm not competent enough to know how to do a proper job of it (I encountered "Fatal Python error: initsite: Failed to import the site module", followed by a Traceback:

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/opt/hdf5/gnu/mvapich2_ib/lib/python2.7/site-packages/site.py", line 75, in <module>
    __boot()
  File "/opt/hdf5/gnu/mvapich2_ib/lib/python2.7/site-packages/site.py", line 27, in __boot
    import imp # Avoid import loop in Python >= 3.3
  File "/home/tburgin/glycosynthases/171110_TmAfc_d224g/eps/Python3/lib/python3.7/imp.py", line 27, in <module>
    import tokenize
  File "/home/tburgin/glycosynthases/171110_TmAfc_d224g/eps/Python3/lib/python3.7/tokenize.py", line 33, in <module>
    import re
  File "/home/tburgin/glycosynthases/171110_TmAfc_d224g/eps/Python3/lib/python3.7/re.py", line 143, in <module>
    class RegexFlag(enum.IntFlag):
AttributeError: module 'enum' has no attribute 'IntFlag'

It looks like Python is trying to use libraries from the 2.7 installation on Comet...?)

Is there an approved means of getting Python 3 working on Comet, or do I just need to bite the bullet and learn how to get my local installation working properly?

Thanks!
