Hi - would it be possible to install Orca (from Frank Neese group at MPI)? The newest version (4.1.1) has a very fast CCSD(T) and CASSCF algorithm. Alternatively, if its not possible to install, I have it downloaded into my home directory and am unable to get it running, having issues with compatibility of openMP. Thanks for considering.
