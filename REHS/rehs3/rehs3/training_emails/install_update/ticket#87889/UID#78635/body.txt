Hi,

I am new in comet and wanted to run some jobs which use the following
packages on python2.7:
*tensorflow*

*argparse*

*os*

*numpy*

*pickle*

*json*

*math*

*random*

*matplotlib*

*logging*

*datetime*

*sys*

*time*

*collections*
I found that I need to work around the singularity and install them. The
example is explained for apt-get command; however, I need to install the
packages through *pip install*. May I know how I can do that?
I also tried below to install tensoflow:
*module load singularity*
*singularity shell /share/apps/gpu/singularity/sdsc_ubuntu_gpu_tf.1.5.img*
but it returns me:
*WARNING: Non existent 'bind path' source: '/scratch'*
*Singularity: Invoking an interactive shell within container...*

Can you please let me know how I can install them?

Thanks
Afshin
