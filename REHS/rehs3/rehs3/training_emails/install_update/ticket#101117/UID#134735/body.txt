Hi,

I am in need of the software packages cutadapt (https://cutadapt.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) and COPE (https://sourceforge.net/projects/coperead/) for the analysis of an exome capture dataset I am running for the Nachman Lab on Comet. Can these two items be installed and made available on Comet?

Thank You and Happy New Year
