Hello,

I am trying to run tests on my code on Comet, and I am consistently
getting crashes with large MPI jobs.  Below 16 nodes (384 cores),
everything seems more or less reliable.  Going beyond that, I often,
but not always, get crashes in MPI.  I am attaching the error output
for one of these jobs.

I have run this code on many different clusters (Harvard's Odyssey,
Yale's Grace, Caltech's Central HPC, Princeton's Feynman, EPFL's
Fidis, Weizmann's WEXAC, and Cornell's CLASSE) using up to 512 cores,
and I have never seen this kind of crash.  The crashes are only with
large jobs, so it is difficult to debug them.  But it seems to happen
when performing a global operation like MPI_Allreduce.

I have been using the GNU compiler to build my code.  To load the
modules, I run

  module unload intel/2013_sp1.2.144
  module load gnu openmpi_ib cmake

The latest Intel compiler installed on Comet (16.0.3 20160415) does
not support enough of C++14 to compile one of the supporting libraries
that I use.  On other clusters, I have been able to compile with
17.0.4 20170411.  I also have problems with the Portland Group compiler.

I tried a different MPI implementation with gcc (mvapich2_ib and
intelmpi), but I get more crashes with those versions.  I noticed that
the Comet guide

  https://portal.xsede.org/sdsc-comet

suggests using openmpi_ib.

So I have a few questions:

1) Is there another MPI that is compatible with the GNU compiler?
2) Is there any plan to install a newer version of the Intel compiler on Comet?

Thank you
