Hello,



I am running benchmarks on the COMET SDSC cpu nodes and keep getting the following error for certain runs:



Could not chdir to home directory /home/rch42: No such file or directory



My other runs which are identical except for the number of nodes have not produced the same error. I am also unable to replicate the issue using two debug nodes. Is there a problem Iâ€™ve missed in my job submission file?



#!/bin/bash

#SBATCH -A dku129

#SBATCH --job-name="NAMD_cpu-time-test"

#SBATCH -p compute

#SBATCH --nodes=64

#SBATCH --ntasks-per-node=24

#SBATCH --export=ALL

#SBATCH -t 00:05:00



module load namd/2.10



ibrun namd2 runconf > log.log



This is in the following directory:



/oasis/scratch/comet/rch42/temp_project/gp140trimer/cpux2



Thanks,
