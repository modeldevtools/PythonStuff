[Ticket created from XUP by jecyrd]
[From: James Currie]
[System: Comet]
[Category: Other]
I've just logged into Comet for the first time, and after the welcome text I see:

"Could not chdir to home directory /home/jecyrd: No such file or directory"

Then I get a standard bash-4.1 prompt and am placed in the / directory.

Below is some output from comet:
