Dear Help,

You have recently added a new user "boffetta" to my account. He cannot
access his scratch space from comet:

[boffetta@comet-ln2 ~]$ ls -l /oasis/scratch/comet/boffetta/
ls: cannot access /oasis/scratch/comet/boffetta/: Permission denied
[boffetta@comet-ln2 ~]$


Please fix.


thank you so much,
Alexei
