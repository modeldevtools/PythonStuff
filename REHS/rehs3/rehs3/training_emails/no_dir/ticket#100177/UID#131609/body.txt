Dear Comet,

When I login the comet cluster I get this warning message, which I haven't seen before: -bash: warning: setlocale: LC_CTYPE: cannot change locale (UTF-8): No such file or directory. 

Presumably related to this issue, my code does not compile and instead gives me the following error message: Catastrophic error: could not set locale "" to allow processing of multibyte characters

Is there an ongoing issue with this on the cluster?

Thanks,
Jaehan Bae
