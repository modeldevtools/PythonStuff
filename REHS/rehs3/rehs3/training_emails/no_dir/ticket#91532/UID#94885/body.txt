Hello,

I created my user yesterday and was added to the Arieh Warshel group allocation.
This morning I was able to successfully connect to comet however there is no home folder under my username (ralhadef) and therefore nothing can practically be done for me to work.

Thank you,
Raphael (username ralhadef)
