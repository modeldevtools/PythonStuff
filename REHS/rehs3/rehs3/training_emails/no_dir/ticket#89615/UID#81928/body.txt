I used the XSEDE login to access Globus, however, when I tried to access XSEDE Comet for one of my endpoints, I got the error "Directory '/~/' not found on endpoint 'de463f97-6d04-11e5-ba46-22000b92c6ec'"  While this may be an error on Globus, the phrasing of the error makes it seem like the error may be coming from Comet.  

Many Thanks.
