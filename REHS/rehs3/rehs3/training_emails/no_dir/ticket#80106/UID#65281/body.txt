Hi,

I cannot run the gromacs module in the login node:

[nano3@comet-ln2 cI_m]$ module load gromacs
[nano3@comet-ln2 cI_m]$ gmx
LiMIC: (limic_open) file open fail
[unset]: aborting job:
Fatal error in PMPI_Init_thread:
Other MPI error, error stack:
MPIR_Init_thread(514)....: 
MPID_Init(359)...........: channel initialization failed
MPIDI_CH3_Init(446)......: 
MPIDI_CH3I_SMP_Init(2313): LiMIC2 device does not exist: No such file or directory

This doesn't seem to be a problem on the GPU nodes themselves, as the jobs I had submitted have been running.

I need to get gromacs to work in the login nodes for input preparation and converting the output file into readable formats. 

Best,
Irem
