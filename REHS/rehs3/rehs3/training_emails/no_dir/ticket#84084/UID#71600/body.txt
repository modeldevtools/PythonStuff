[Ticket created from XUP by gaozihou]

[System: Comet]

Hello,

My user-id is "gaozihou", and I am in project "csd562" on comet. When I login to comet, it shows the following error message:

Could not chdir to home directory /home/gaozihou: No such file or directory

It seems that I do not have a home directory on comet. What should I do to create my own home directory?

Thanks!
Paul
