I am enrolled in a CS 6150 course with George Rudolph at Utah Valley
University. He set us up with accounts in XSEDE, but I am having problems
getting anything to run on Comet. I have been able to log into Comet, and
add jar files, but don't really know what to do to get things to run. Are
there any tutorials available that you can suggest? I haven't been able to
find any that have been helpful to me. My teacher said we should set the
class path to something containing our usernames, but when I try to create
a folder to set my class path to, I don't have permission to do so. He
suggested that we email this address with questions if we're stuck.

Thanks,
Kale
