Dear,

I am trying to run the simulations with DFT in comet, but the system gives the error of "LiMIC2 device does not exist: No such file or directory". I used to run DFT in comet well, I guess the LiMIC2 device is deleted or damaged. Could you please take a look at that problem? Thanks very much! 

Best,
Jiaqi
