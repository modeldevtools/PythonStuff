Dear all,

I am trying to set up a calculation using the version of gpaw (gpaw/1.2.0) installed on comet. I prepared a simple SLURM script following the indication on the website (see files on /home/rjm166/WRKDIR/Nov2018/gapw-test/test2). However, I have a problem still with the submission. 
This is the error file I get:
-------------------------------------------------------
/home/jpg/opt/gpaw/bin/gpaw-python: error while loading shared libraries: libtorque.so.2: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
--------------------------------------------------

Could you please help me out finding the solution to this problem. 

I appreciate your help.

Best regards,

RJM
