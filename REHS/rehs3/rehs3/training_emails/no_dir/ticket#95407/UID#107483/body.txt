Hi,

I have a lot of files in the /home/$USER directory which I was trying to copy to /oasis/scratch/comet/$USER/temp_project or back into our university cluster. For some reason when I copy, the memory reduces. Let's say I have a folder with 20 GB in the home directory. When I copy it to /oasis/scratch/comet/$USER/temp_project, it reduces to say, ~ 12 GB (approx.). Depending on what command I use the memory changes by a small amount. I have used cp -r, cp -rf, scp -r all of these. Any idea what is happening? I have millions of files so it's not possible for me to manually check but it looks like I have all the files. But, I can't be sure. 

Thank you.
