Hello,
I have opened my xsede account yesterday and I was added to my project. I can see everything is in order when I login to my profile online. But I cannot find my folder in the home directory when I login through terminal. Also I cannot add or edit any file. Can you please check what might be the problem ?

Sincerely,
Ratul.
