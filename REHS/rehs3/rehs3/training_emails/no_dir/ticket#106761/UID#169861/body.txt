Greetings,


My name is Chasen Campbell, my xsede username is crcamp48, and I was given access to comet by my P.I. on 4-11-19. I am using the PUTTY SSH.

I am trying to access the comet work directory, but there is no home directory for me. I am met with an error message that says:


Could not chdir to home directory /home/crcamp48: No such file or directory

The error message occurs immediately after I log in to comet and all of the command lines are prompted with
-bash-4.1$



When I tried to create a directory, I was met with another error that says: Permission denied


What can be done to fix this?

Thank you for your time,
Chasen Campbell
