Hi there,

I am a UCSD student  who choose the UCSD CSE 260 course and plan to use Comet for the test of the assignment. I can login to Comet but after welcome information is shown it says ‘Could not chdir to home directory /home/ushw: No such file or directory’ with my user name for Comet to be ushw. 

Other possible necessary information are listed below. My Xsede user portal login name is shawnw. I belongs to the following projects: Parallel Computation Class Project PI:chin, bryan Charge #:TG-ASC170065. And for computation resource I have: Comet	comet.sdsc.xsede.org	SDSC	ushw.

Thank you very much for helping me solve this problem.
