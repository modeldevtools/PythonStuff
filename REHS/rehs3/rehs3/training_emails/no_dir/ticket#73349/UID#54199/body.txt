When I log in to Comet, I get the following error message:

Could not chdir to home directory /home/pbehrooz: No such file or directory

It appears that my home directory has not been created on the system.  While I can use the scratch space to run programs, I cannot save, e.g., SSH preferences or source files in long-term storage.
