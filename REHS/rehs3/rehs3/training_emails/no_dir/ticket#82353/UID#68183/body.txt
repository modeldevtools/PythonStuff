HI,
I have a question about login the comet. If I log in as this way : ssh cong123@login.xsede.org <mailto:cong123@login.xsede.org>. and type my passport. I can come to the DUO interface to login successful. But when I gsissh comet, they couldnâ€™t find my /home/cong123. So I cannot do the following steps.

Another question:if I just log in : ssh cong123@comet.sdsc.edu <mailto:cong123@comet.sdsc.edu>. I type my passport, It always wrong and tells me permission denied.Why can I login via SSO but can not via comet.sdsc.edu <http://comet.sdsc.edu/>?
