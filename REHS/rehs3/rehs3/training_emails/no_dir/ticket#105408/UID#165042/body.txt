Hi,



I'm trying to transfer file to/from an endpoint hosted on SDSC Data Oasis.  But I'm getting the following error, which indicates that SDSC no longer has an active Globus subscription:



[cid:part1.3233CEF1.95113AC8@ucsd.edu]



Please let me know what the problem is, and what I need to do on my end to be able to transfer files to/from SDSC Data Oasis.



Thanks,

- Mai
