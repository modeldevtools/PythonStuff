Hi,

I am trying to use tau with PAPI support on Comet as in ticket #84521, but
I am still running into some issues.

The sbatch script I am using is at /home/siyu/projects/test.sh and runs tau
to profile a simple test program. According to the documentation, there
should be a new directory containing the measurements related to counter 1,
but no such directory is created and the log displays no issues.

I am wondering if there are any additional packages I should be importing
or if I am doing something incorrectly since tau w/ papi does work on my
local machine.

Thanks for your time & help.

Best,
Chester
