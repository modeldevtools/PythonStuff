Hello, 

How to login comet-gpu? I tried "gsissh comet-gpu", but it gave me the error "name or service not known". 
I tried "gsissh comet", it works but there is no home dir of my account, the error is "Could not chdir to home directory /home/wwu12: No such file or directory". 
BTW, in "My XSEDES -> Account", I can see my local account on comet-gpu.

Thanks, 
Wei
