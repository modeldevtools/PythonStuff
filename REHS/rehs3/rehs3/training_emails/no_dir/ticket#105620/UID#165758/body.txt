Hi, I'm trying to backup my data using Globus, but it doesn't always work. For instance, today I tried transferring a directory, but after starting the transfer, it never loaded any files, and then reported a connection error.

Is there anything I can do to ensure it is working correctly? I'll also try reviewing the online manual.

Thanks

Jon
