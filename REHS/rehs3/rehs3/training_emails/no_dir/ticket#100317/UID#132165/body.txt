Dear Help Desk,

When I run "ifort -v" command, I got error:
ifort: error #10001: could not find directory in which g++ resides

This error happens occasionally. When it happens, I cannot compile my codes with ifort.
Most of the time, the "ifort -v" command works well, and I have no problem in compiling my codes.

Below is what modules I loaded:
Currently Loaded Modulefiles:
  1) intel/2013_sp1.2.144   5) netcdf/4.3.2           9) mkl/11.1.2.144
  2) mvapich2_ib/2.1        6) ncview/2.1.7          10) python/2.7.10
  3) gnutools/2.69          7) matlab/2018a
  4) hdf5/1.8.14            8) visit/2.9.1

Thank you,
Peng
