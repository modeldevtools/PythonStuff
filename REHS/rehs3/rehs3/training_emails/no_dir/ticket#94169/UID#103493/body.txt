Hello, 

An error occurred when I attempted to log in the Comet which read "Could not chdir to home directory /home/liubinxu: No such file or directory
/usr/bin/xauth:  error in locking authority file /home/liubinxu/.Xauthority". 
After a while I tried logging in again, but this time "authentication failed", though I am very sure I entered the correct password. 

It would be of great help if you could have a look into the problem. Thanks in advance!

Best,
Liubin
