Good morning,

I've added several of grad students to our Campus Champion allocation in 
order to get them up-and-running on XSEDE: Serdar Birinci (birin), 
Joaquin Garcia-Cabo (garci584), and Kurt See (kurtsee). However, all 
three are reporting issues. Both Serdar and Kurt are unable to login to 
Comet. garci584 is able to log into Comet, but does not have a home 
directory. Are there steps we missed in setting them up?

Cheers,
David
