[From: Shyam Saladi]
[System: Comet]
[Category: System/Hardware Issues]
Is it possible to share files (say an executable that I've compiled and wrote a module file for) with other users on comet that are not sharing compute time/not part of my group? If so, how so I do this?

When I sent someone the raw address... /home/saladi1/privatemodules, they were not abel to access the folder or even see /home/saladi1 (unless I was logged into specifically the same login node).

Thanks,
Shyam
