Hello,

I am trying to transfer data from /oasis/scratch/comet/kbarber2/temp_project.... directory using Globus but the system keeps timing out when it tries to change into that directory or any other directory outside of my home directory. I have also tried /oasis/scratch-comet/kbarber2... but that did not work either. 

Thank you for your help!
