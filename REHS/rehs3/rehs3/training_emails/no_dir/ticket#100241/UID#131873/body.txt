[Ticket created from XUP by lynnwang]
[From: LYNN WANG]
[System: Comet]
[Category: Access/Login Issues]
When I login in, the Comet system shows WELCOME TO COMET, but no my account. The information lists below: 
"Could not chdir to home directory /home/lynnwang: No such file or directory
/usr/bin/xauth:  error in locking authority file /home/lynnwang/.Xauthority"
How can I do to solve this problem?
The attachments include three photos.
I am looking forward to your reply. Thank you very much!
