When I compile my code with this command "mpifort -o main1 parameters1.f90 main.f90 -L/home/sli43/software/lapack-3.6.0 -llapack -lrefblas",

I get this error : "ifort: error #10001: could not find directory in which g++ resides".

my work directory is at "/oasis/scratch/comet/sli43/temp_project/magnetic_sus/2DHubbard/1"
