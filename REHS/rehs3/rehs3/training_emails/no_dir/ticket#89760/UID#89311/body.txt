Dear Help:


I am trying to run the attached python script. When I test it on the front end, it works, but when I sbatch it I get:


  File "/var/spool/slurmd/job16840052/slurm_script", line 10
    ./radtag0_trimmer.py -p Kimble_RADSeq_S1_S1_L001_R2_001.fastq ND_barcodes5.txt Kimble_RADSeq_S1_S1_L001_R2_001.fastq
    ^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax

Can you help me figure out what is wrong?


Thanks,

Steve
