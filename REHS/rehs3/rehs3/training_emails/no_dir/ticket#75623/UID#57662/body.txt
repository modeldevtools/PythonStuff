[Ticket created from XUP by wzygmunt]
[From: William Zygmunt]
[System: Comet]
[Category: Access/Login Issues]
I applied for a trial allocation on Comet, which was approved last week. I still cannot login to:

"ssh wzygmunt@comet.sdsc.xsede.org"

If I try that, the system does not accept my password and I can never log in.

If I log into:

"ssh -l wzygmunt login.xsede.org"

and I try to do:

"gsissh comet"

I get:

"Could not chdir to home directory /home/wzygmunt: No such file or directory"

I'm not sure what the issue is.
