Dear XSEDE administrator,



I tried to login to the comet for the first time. I got the following message



“Could not chdir to home directory /home/kadkhoda: No such file or directory”



I could successfully login, but there seems to be no home directory set up for me. My question is how to get a home directory. Additionally, when I add students in my class as new users, how to make sure that they have home directory for themselves. I would really appreciate it if you could help me with this.



Best
