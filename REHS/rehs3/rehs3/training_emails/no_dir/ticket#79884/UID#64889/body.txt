we are teaching a parallel computation class using comet.
One of my student's - juq310@eng.ucsd.edu - xsede user name juncheng, has a home directory
owned by "nobody" with group permissions "ddp254".

The rest of the class - i believe - is in the group csd562 and has their home directory owned appropriately.

thanks
