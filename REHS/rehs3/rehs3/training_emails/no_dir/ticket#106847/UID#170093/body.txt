I am using Comet (TG-CHE160101) in class as a teaching tool.  My students were added over the weekend, but when they logged in they didn't have a home directory.  (could not chdir to home directory /home/username:  no such file or directory).  This is the case for the following accounts:  coleh19, kkrs821, nshann, pzayka.

Thanks,
Nicole
