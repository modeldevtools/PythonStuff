Hi,

I was recently added to our group allocation on Comet. But, when I try to log in, I get the following error message, suggesting that my account has not been completely set up on Comet.

"Could not chdir to home directory /home/longz: No such file or directory"

I have also attached the screenshot, showing this message.

Could you please help in resolving me this problem and setting up my account on Comet?


Thanks,
Long
