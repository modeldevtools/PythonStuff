Today I made a mistake by typing " rm *  comet" instead of " rm *comet* and all my files in the directory /home/rbirke/stuff/Manganates were removed because of the space after the asterisk. This directory has all my work for the last 10 months. Please recover this directory as of yesterday 11/7/2018. I am very anxious on account of this mistake and hope there is no problem in restoring the files.
               Sincerely,
                                Ron
