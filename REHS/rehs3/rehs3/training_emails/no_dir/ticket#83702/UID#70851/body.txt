Hi Mahidhar,

I would need your help for a problem I met with the data:
these files :

/home/kesf/PROJECTS/USW4/Run/SCRATCH/AVG_Y1997M01/uswc4_bgc_flux_avg.*
and same for all directories AVG_Y199*/uswc4_bgc_flux_avg.*
eg: /home/kesf/PROJECTS/USW4/Run/SCRATCH/AVG_Y1997M01/
uswc4_bgc_flux_avg.00001.nc
cannot be opened with matlab or other tools, but I can view them with
ncview only. They look containing all variables and good model outputs.
Also, their size is about 1.1G each one, but when I upload them to my own
server, the size  increases to 91G.
Is it possible to look at them please, maybe you can detect something to
resolve the problem.
Thanks a lot for your help.

Cheers,
Faycal
