Hi,
I have a startup allocation on SDSC Comet and I am trying to transfer some files using Globus. I have set up my Globus account and I have been following the instructions on the tutorial/user guide available on SDSC website regarding Globus online sharing. When I am choosing the path /oasis/scratch/comet/faribam/temp_project for the endpoint it is telling me "Directory not found".

Also it is mentioned in the instructions that I need Globus Plus Subscription which I can request at SDSC. 

Is there anything that I am missing that needs to done for file sharing?

Thanks,
Fariba Mohammadi
