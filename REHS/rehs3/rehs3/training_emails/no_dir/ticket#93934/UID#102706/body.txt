Hi,

I'm trying to create a shared endpoint pointing to a directory on 
/oasis/scratch/comet.  I'm getting the following error message:

Is it possible to create an endpoint on /oasis/scratch/comet?

Also, there is a message stating that the endpoint's activation expires 
in 11 days.  Do endpoints remain active only for a certain number of 
days?  Is there a way to keep them active longer?

Thanks,
- Mai
