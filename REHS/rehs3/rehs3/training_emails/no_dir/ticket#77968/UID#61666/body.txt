I have a recently activated trial account. I tried logging into the comet system's login nodes, but every time I log in I get the following error:

Could not chdir to home directory /home/ie3md: No such file or directory

I tried going through the SSO portal and still got the same result.

It seems the environment was initialized correctly, but the home directory was not created.

$ env | grep ie3md
USER=ie3md
MAIL=/var/spool/mail/ie3md
HOME=/home/ie3md
LOGNAME=ie3md
