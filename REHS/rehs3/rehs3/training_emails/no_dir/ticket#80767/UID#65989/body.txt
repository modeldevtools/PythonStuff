Dear Sir/Madam

I have already been added to our allocation on the comet but when I try to get access, I get an error message which says that 
"Could not chdir to home directory /home/reza1789: No such file or directory"
Also, I have attached the screenshot of this error message. 

I would appreciate if you could help me resolving this issue.
Thank you for your time and effort.

Best,
Reza
