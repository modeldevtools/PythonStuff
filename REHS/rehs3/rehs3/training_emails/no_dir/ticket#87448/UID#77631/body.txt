I have been receiving the following error messages when I am using Globus with the XSEDE Comet endpoint to transfer files to my desktop, even though I was able to transfer 2 files from Comet before seeing these messages.  I am not sure how to proceed to correct these issues.

Unable to open XSEDE Comet. You may have used a link with an origin endpoint that you donâ€™t have permissions to view.

Directory '/~/' not found on endpoint 'de463f97-6d04-11e5-ba46-22000b92c6ec'
