Hello,

I plan to use Gaussian on Comet, is it possible to add me to the Gaussian user list? Thank you for your kindly help.

Another thing is on Comet, I do not have a home directory:
"Could not chdir to home directory /home/rlai: No such file or directory".
Could you please create a home directory for me? If I do not have the permission to have one, could you please tell me where can I store source files, modify files and compile source code? Thank you for your kindly help.

Best regards,
Rui Lai
