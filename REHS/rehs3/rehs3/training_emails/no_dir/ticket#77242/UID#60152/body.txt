Hi, I have a script to run a batch job that an xsede administrator helped me write about 6 months ago. It seems like this script assumes that there is a /scratch directory that needs to be written to in order to run the job, and the output also seems like it is directed to /scratch. But I don't see a /scratch directory anymore. I'm wondering if something has changed about the directory setup since I last run this script. Does the script need to be modified to use a different temporary directory (like /tmp?). Sorry for the very basic question! Any help would be greatly appreciated.
