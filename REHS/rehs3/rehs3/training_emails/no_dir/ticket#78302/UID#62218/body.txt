[Ticket created from XUP by jesusms]
[From: Jesus Salas]
[System: Comet]
[Category: Access/Login Issues]
Hello, 
Whenever I try to login to Comet the following message appears: 
Could not chdir to home directory /home/jesusms: No such file or directory
Is this because my home directory hasn't been created, since my allocation was approved just recently? Or do I need to create my own?
Thank you
