Dear Administrator,
         I have been unable to submit any jobs from this afternoon. The error message is 

sbatch: error: bank_limit plugin: not found user association wufeng
sbatch: error: Batch job submission failed: Invalid account or account/partition combination specified
         
       Could you help to resolve this issue? Thanks.

Best,
Feng
