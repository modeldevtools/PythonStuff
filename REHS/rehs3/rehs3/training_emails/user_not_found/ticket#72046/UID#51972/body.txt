Hello,

I used to be able to run gaussian with extended wall time using --qos=oneweek, but after new allocation was granted I am not able to submit these jobs.

This is the error I am getting:

sbatch: error: Batch job submission failed: Job has invalid dos

Can I get access to run these jobs again? I would need not more than 3-4 shared nodes (12 cores) at a time.

Thanks,
Maxim
