Hi, I think I used to submit jobs to comet without any problem. Today, when I submit a job, I got the following error:

sbatch: error: bank_limit plugin: not found user association seonah
sbatch: error: Batch job submission failed: Invalid account or account/partition combination specified

Is our allocation starting Oct. 1st? That's why I cannot submit a job??? or some other issue?

Thanks,

Seonah.
