[Ticket created from XUP by rosecers]
[From: Rose Cersonsky]
[System: Comet]
[Category: Batch Queues/Jobs]
To whom it may concern,
My account seems active, but whenever I try and submit a job, I'm given this error:

sbatch: error: bank_limit plugin: not found user association rosecers
sbatch: error: Batch job submission failed: Invalid account or account/partition combination specified

An example job script is:

#!/bin/bash
#SBATCH -a rosecers
#SBATCH -p shared                 # partition (queue)
#SBATCH -N 1                      # number of nodes
#SBATCH -n 1                      # number of cores
#SBATCH --mem 2G                  # memory pool for all cores
#SBATCH -t 2-00:00                # time (D-HH:MM)
#SBATCH -o slurm.%N.%j.out        # STDOUT
#SBATCH -e slurm.%N.%j.err        # STDERR
#SBATCH --mail-type=END,FAIL      # notifications for job done & fail
#SBATCH --mail-user=krosenburg1991@gmail.com

echo "Done"
