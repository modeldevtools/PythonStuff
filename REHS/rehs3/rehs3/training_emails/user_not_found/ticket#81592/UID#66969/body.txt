Dear XSEDE team,

I have got supplemental resources and want to do few
scaling test to submit the full proposal. I was intimated
that it will take 5 days for it to get reflected in my account.
It shows in my allocation on the XSEDE home page but
however I cannot submit a job on comet.

I am appending the message at the bottom.

sbatch: error: bank_limit plugin: not found user association okf
sbatch: error: Batch job submission failed: Invalid account or account/partition combination specified


Can you please look into it?
Regards,
Summayya
