 Hello,

I am trying to run a Gaussian job on Comet and am running into some kind of
failure. This is my first submitted job in several months and my first job
on a new allocation so I would not be surprised if there's something about
my credentials or allocation authorization that needs to be updated. It's
been over 24 hours since the allocation first came down so I thought it
would be okay now. Could you help me figure out what is happening?

This is what returns when I tried to run my script.

sbatch: error: bank_limit plugin: not found user association cjmcgill
sbatch: error: Batch job submission failed: Invalid account or
account/partition combination specified.

Thanks,
Charles McGill
