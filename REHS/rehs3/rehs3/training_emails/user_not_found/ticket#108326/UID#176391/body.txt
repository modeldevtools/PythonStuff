Hello,

I'm trying to get started with a project on Comet, but when I run the command from the user guide for requesting an interactive session (

srun --partition=debug --pty --nodes=1 --ntasks-per-node=24 -t 00:30:00 --wait=0 --export=ALL /bin/bash), ​I get the following error:


srun: error: bank_limit plugin: expired user, can't submit job

srun: error: Unable to allocate resources: Invalid account or account/partition combination specified

​What can be done about this?


Thanks,

Daniel Giger
