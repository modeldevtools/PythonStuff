Hi XSEDE Helpdesk,



I have an account on Comet (username: amerson) and would like to reset my password. However, I have just discovered that I do not actually have an account on the XSEDE User Portal.Is it possible to create for me an account so that I can change my login details for Comet?



If it helps, I have included below a recent email conversation regarding my account allocation on Comet.



Thanks,



Alex

I will transfer 10K SUS to JET102, these SUs should be available on the system by 5pm(PT).

Let me know if you need anything else.

Hi Nicole,



Thanks for the quick response!  Please restore Alex’s project, JET102, with an allocation of 10,000 SUs, for now.



Alex - we can always increase your usage if you use that all up, but please let us know if you think you’ll need a larger allocation to start out with.

HI Edward-

The unused SUs(149,990/150,000) were returned to JPL master allocation last year.  How much time would you like to put on Alex’s allocation, JET102?



Regards,

Nicole
