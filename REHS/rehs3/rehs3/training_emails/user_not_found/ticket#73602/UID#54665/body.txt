Hi,

I was not able to submit my run from yesterday. My command file is:
#!/bin/bash
#SBATCH --job-name="run02b"
#SBATCH --output="liberty.%j.%N.out"
#SBATCH --partition=debug
#SBATCH --nodes=2
#SBATCH --ntasks-per-node=24
#SBATCH --export=ALL
#SBATCH -t 00:30:00

#This job runs with 1 nodes, 24 cores per node for a total of 24 cores.
#ibrun in verbose mode will give binding detail

ibrun -v ./pschism_COMET_VL_ICM


The error message shows as:

There was an error running the SLURM sbatch command.
The command was:
'/usr/bin/sbatch run_comet  2>&1'
and the output was:
'sbatch: error: bank_limit plugin: not found user association xcai
 sbatch: error: Batch job submission failed: Invalid account or account/partition combination specified
'

Thanks for your help!
