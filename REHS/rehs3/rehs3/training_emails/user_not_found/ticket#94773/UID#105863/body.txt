Dear colleagues at help desk,

When submitting jobs today with sbatch command, I encountered some errors as shown below:

There was an error running the SLURM sbatch command.
The command was:
'/usr/bin/sbatch aiidasubmit.sh  2>&1'
and the output was:
'sbatch: error: bank_limit plugin: error talking to slurm, please try again
 sbatch: error: Batch job submission failed: Error configuring interconnect

Is there something wrong with Comet?

Bests
