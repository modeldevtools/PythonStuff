Hey,

My username is a6810 and I'm on grant number:TG-CCR110036. While Trying to submit Tensorflow jobs I'm getting this error:
sbatch: error: bank_limit plugin: not found user association a6810
sbatch: error: Batch job submission failed: Invalid account or account/partition combination specified

Can you please tell me what this is?

Thanks
Ashesh
