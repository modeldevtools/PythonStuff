I try to submit my job and get the following issue:

sbatch: error: Batch job submission failed: Job violates accounting/QOS policy (job submit limit, user's size and/or time limits)

I have run this job multiple times with the same batch specs and no issue. This error also occurs on my other system with the path:
/oasic/scratch/comet/tcline/temp_project/sh1/rest2
