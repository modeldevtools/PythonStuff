Dear XSEDE support,

when submitting a job on SDSC Comet using the sbatch command, I receive this error message:

sbatch: error: bank_limit plugin: error talking to slurm, please try again
sbatch: error: Batch job submission failed: Error configuring interconnect

I was able to run jobs earlier this week.

Thank you for your help.

Best wishes,
 Erik
