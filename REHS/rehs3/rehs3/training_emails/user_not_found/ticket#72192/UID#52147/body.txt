[Ticket created from XUP by liangfu]
[From: Liang Fu]
[System: Comet]
[Category: Allocations]
To whom it may concern,

The application for transfering SUS to Comet is approved, but when submitting the jobs, it shows as follows: 
sbatch: error: bank_limit plugin: not found user association liangfu
sbatch: error: Batch job submission failed: Invalid account or account/partition combination specified

It seems that the SUS of Comet cannot be used. Is it induced by the deadline? and is it possible to apply for an extension for six months?

Thank you very much!
