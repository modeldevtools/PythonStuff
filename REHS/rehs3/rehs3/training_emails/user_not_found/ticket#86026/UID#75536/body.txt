Hello,
I am trying to run VASP on Comet and am running into issues with the scheduler. The error I receive is:

sbatch: error: bank_limit plugin: not found user association jchapman
sbatch: error: Batch job submission failed: Invalid account or account/partition combination specified

I'm guessing this has something to do with slurm not recognizing who I am but I have no idea how to fix this. My submission script is this:

#!/bin/sh

#SBATCH -J Al_mech4-04_GO
#SBATCH --nodes=2
#SBATCH --ntasks-per-node=24

#SBATCH -p compute
#SBATCH -t 48:00:00

module load intelmpi
module load vasp

mpirun vasp

If it means anything, it has been over a year since I last tried logging in and using Comet. Any help you can give would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.
