Hi there!

I've been having issues with jobs staying in queue for hours. Some jobs recently have stayed in queue for nearly twelve hours. I was wondering if there was a quick fix, or is this an effect of many users using Comet all at once. Any help/ advice would greatly appreciated. 

Kind regards, 
Aaron Morrenzin
