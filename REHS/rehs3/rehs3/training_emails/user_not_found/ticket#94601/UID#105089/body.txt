Hi, 
 attempted  to submit a vasp job on comet  but it did not run giving me the following error.

"[owarek@comet-ln3 var1]$ sbatch vasp.sb
sbatch: error: bank_limit plugin: user is disallowed to submit jobs
sbatch: error: Batch job submission failed: Invalid account or account/partition combination specified"

Could you help me sort this out
