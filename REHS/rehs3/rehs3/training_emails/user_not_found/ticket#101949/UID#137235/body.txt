Hi, 

I have a valid comet allocation, but I cannot submit jobs. 

[milinda@comet-ln2 ~]$ srun -A TG-PHY180054 --partition=debug --pty --nodes=1 --ntasks-per-node=24 -t 00:30:00 --wait=0 --export=ALL /bin/bash
srun: error: Unable to allocate resources: Invalid account or account/partition combination specified

Am I doing something wrong here, 

Thanks 
Milinda.
