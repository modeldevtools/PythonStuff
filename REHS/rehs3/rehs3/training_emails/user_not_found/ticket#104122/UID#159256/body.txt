[Category: Allocations]
Hello,

Users on our allocation,  #TG-DMS140028, are missing allocation accounts on Comet, even though the XSEDE's portal show available SUs.

[nvladimi@comet-ln3 test]$ show_accounts nvladimi
ID name      project      used     available    used_by_proj
------------------------------------------------------------
No accounts found for user nvladimi on platform sdsc_comet.

[nvladimi@comet-ln3 test]$ show_accounts jsanwal
ID name      project      used     available    used_by_proj
------------------------------------------------------------
No accounts found for user jsanwal on platform sdsc_comet.


Is there anything we need to do to reactivate the accounts?

Thank you,

Natalia
