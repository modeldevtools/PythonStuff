Hello,

I recently had my account (username: jpajak) put onto a project (
*Charge #:**TG-DMR150066*) but am having trouble submitting jobs and
accessing my account.

The account shows up under "My projects" on the website, and when I manage
allocations, my username is listed as a user in the project.

However, when I ssh into comet.sdsc.xsede.org and run show_accounts, it
says that I do not have any active accounts and I am not able to run jobs.
I tried to shh into comet-gpu.sdsc.xsede, but that does not work either.

I am confused as how to proceed.

Thank you,
Joshua Pajak
