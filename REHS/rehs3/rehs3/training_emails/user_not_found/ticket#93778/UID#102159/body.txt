Hello,

I wanted to check on my project DDP285. When I go to the XSEDE user portal and click on the 'allocations/usage' link, it pulls up a project that I am unfamiliar with, which has a project number of TG-ASC150024 for which the PI is Mahidhar Tatineni (I don't know who that is). Is my project DDP285 still active, and if so can you have it associated with my project.

Thank you.
