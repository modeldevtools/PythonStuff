Hi,

This might be a silly question, but I can't seem to make it work...

I've gotten a new startup allocation and am attempting to run a job on comet using the srun modifier --account, but run in the following error:

[spetrovi@comet-ln2 Sec16DIM-Sec13]$ srun --account="TG-MCB180200" submit-k80_step4.cmd 
srun: error: bank_limit plugin: expired user, can't submit job
srun: error: Unable to allocate resources: Invalid account or account/partition combination specified


Is there an issue with my approach (I've tried also using the allocation number without quotation marks), or is this allocation not active?

Cheers,
Stefan
