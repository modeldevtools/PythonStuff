To whom it may concern,

I have attempted to run an interactive job that I have requested before on Comet but now I get this error.

The command & error:
srun --partition=debug --pty --nodes=1 --ntasks-per-node=1 -t 00:30:00 --wait=0 --export=ALL /bin/bash
srun: error: bank_limit plugin: not found user association skk74
srun: error: Unable to allocate resources: Invalid account or account/partition combination specified
