I am trying to run the following command:

srun --partition=debug --pty --nodes=1 --ntasks-per-node=24 -t 00:30:00 --wait=0 --export=ALL /bin/bash

I get this error in return:

srun: error: bank_limit plugin: not found user association willc97
srun: error: Unable to allocate resources: Invalid account or account/partition combination specified

I should be in the allocation and be able to submit a batch script? Thanks!
