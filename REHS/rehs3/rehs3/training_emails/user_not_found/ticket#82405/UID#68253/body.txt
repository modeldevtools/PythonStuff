Hi,

I used srun command to debug my code, but frequently get killed. I tried
both 8G and 12G memory, which seems quite sufficient for me. But both job
get killed. Do you have any suggestions on how to set the mem, hours, etc?

My command is:

srun --partition=debug --pty --nodes=1 --ntasks-per-node=24 -t 00:30:00
--wait=0 --export=ALL /bin/bash

Thank you

Best
