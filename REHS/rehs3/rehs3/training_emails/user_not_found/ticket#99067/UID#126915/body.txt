One of my students, Pouya Khazaei, gets the error message 
"sbatch: error: bank_limit plugin: not found user association pkhazaei
sbatch: error: Batch job submission failed: Invalid account or account/partition combination specified"
when he submits a batch job in Comet.

I don't know if this is relevant, but he has to use the username pkhazaei to ssh into Comet, but to log into the xsede portal he has to use the username pouyakh

pkhazaei is actually his email address. pouhakh is what he chose as his username
