I have two projects and need to use one of them using #SBATCH -A << project name >>.
The projects I have are:

1. Purdue Campus Champion
Project PI:Zhu, Xiao Charge #:TG-CDA090008

2. Array Section Interface for Heterogeneous Devices andMultiple Languages
Project PI:Midkiff, Samuel Pratt Charge #:TG-CCR170020

I'm able to see these projects on XSEDE user portal, but I couldn't find the project name on clusters. When I use "show_accounts" command on Comet, I see the following:

ckbest83@comet-ln2 ~]$ show_accounts
ID name      project      used     available    used_by_proj
------------------------------------------------------------
ckbest83     prd129       0        50000        33938

Also, "id -Gn" shows the same result, only one project (or group) name.

Is this something related to system update on backend so I need to wait few more days? I've got approved 7 days ago, 8/15.
