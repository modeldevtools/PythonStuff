Hello,

I'm attempting to run some code in an interactive session using srun on 
the Comet cluster at SDSC but it seems I'm running into user account 
problems. The command I type is:

srun --partition=debug --pty --nodes=1 --ntasks-per-node=8 -t 00:10:00 
--wait=0 --export=ALL /bin/bash

The output is:

srun: error: bank_limit plugin: not found user association qenupve
srun: error: Unable to allocate resources: Invalid account or 
account/partition combination specified

I logged into the XSEDE user portal, went to "My XSEDE --> 
Allocations/Usage" and I see active Comet allocation with spare SUs. My 
advisor suggested I type "show_accounts" on Comet and says I should be 
associated with project ucb274, but instead I get:

ID name      project      used     available    used_by_proj
------------------------------------------------------------

No accounts found for user qenupve on platform sdsc_comet.

Any help would be appreciated.

Thanks,
~Richard McWhirter (qenupve)
