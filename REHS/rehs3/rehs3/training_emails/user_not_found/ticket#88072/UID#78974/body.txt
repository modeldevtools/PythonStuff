Hi,
This is my first time on Comet, and I was unable to submit a job. The error message was,

sbatch: error: bank_limit plugin: not found user association kcoshic
sbatch: error: Batch job submission failed: Invalid account or account/partition combination specified

A person from my group (having access to my directory) was able to submit the same job, I guess I don't have the privileges for the same. Please let me know what the issue is and if anything should be done on my behalf.

Thanks,
Kush Coshic
