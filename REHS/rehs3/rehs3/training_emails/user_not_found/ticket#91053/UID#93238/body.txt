Hello, 

My name is Yu Xuan Lin. My account # is TG-MCB140073, and my project PI is Miller III, Bill Ray. I am currently having trouble submitting jobs. my job file is called md.sh and sbatch md.sh give me an error output that basically says job submission failed because comet can't find user association for my account (ylin). Both my job file and the error output file is attached below.
