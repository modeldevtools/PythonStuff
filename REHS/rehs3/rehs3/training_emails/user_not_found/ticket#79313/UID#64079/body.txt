I am unable to run an interactive session on the debug partition using the following resource request:
srun --partition=debug -t 00:30:00  --ntasks=1 --nodes=1  --pty /bin/bash

I am met with the following error:
srun: error: bank_limit plugin: not found user association mhashemi
srun: error: Unable to allocate resources: Invalid account or account/partition combination specified

We are currently in the process of transferring 100% of our Comet allocation to Comet-gpu, so that may be the issue - it is very strange since I have not experienced similar issues in the past during an allocation transfer.
