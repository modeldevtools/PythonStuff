Hi, I got following error message when submitting job on comet:

There was an error running the SLURM sbatch command.
The command was:
'/usr/bin/sbatch /oasis/scratch/comet/liuqian/temp_project/output/GOM/autorun/out/20180314T100105/gom_20180314T100105_0001runfile.sh  2>&1'
and the output was:
'sbatch: error: bank_limit plugin: not found user association liuqian
 sbatch: error: Batch job submission failed: Invalid account or account/partition combination specified
'
Is it associated with my account allocation? I have checked my XSEDE user account, there are still a plenty of SUs available though.

Thanks in advance for your help!

Cheers,
Liuqian
