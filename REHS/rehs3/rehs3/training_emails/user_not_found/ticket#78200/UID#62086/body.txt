Dear Sir/Madam,
I am working on comet and my user is alhussen. I am trying to run a job by srun and sbatch command but there is an error when I try to run the commands. The error is:
sbatch: error: bank_limit plugin: not found user association alhussen
sbatch: error: Batch job submission failed: Invalid account or account/partition combination specified

and 

srun: error: bank_limit plugin: not found user association alhussen
srun: error: Unable to allocate resources: Invalid account or account/partition combination specified

Thank you
