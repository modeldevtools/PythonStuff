Dear all, 

I have the following error when submitting a job, although I am added 
in the project TG-CTS120005. My colleagues do not have this issue.

srun: error: bank_limit plugin: not found user association bdorschn
srun: error: Unable to allocate resources: Invalid account or account/partition combination specified

Thanks a lot for you help!

Best wishes,
Benedikt
