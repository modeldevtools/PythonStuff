[System: Comet]
[Category: Allocations]
Hello,

Currently, it appears my jobs cannot be submitted to Comet. The specific details are provided below:

directory:
/oasis/scratch/comet/dwinogra/temp_project/DNA_sequence/sameSeed-3MNaCl

when running
>> sbatch MD01.sb

The following error message is returned:
"""
sbatch: error: bank_limit plugin: not found user association dwinogra
sbatch: error: Batch submission failed: Invalid account or account/partition combination specified
"""

Do you happen to know why this error is occurring? and what, if anything, I can do to run jobs successfully on Comet?

Thanks,
David Winogradoff
