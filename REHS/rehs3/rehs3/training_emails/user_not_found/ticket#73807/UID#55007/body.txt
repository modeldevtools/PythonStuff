To whom it may concern,

Greetings. Unfortunately, we cannot submit any jobs on the comet. We get the following error:
There was an error running the SLURM sbatch command.
The command was:
'/usr/bin/sbatch abaqus_comet.sh  2>&1'
and the output was:
'sbatch: error: bank_limit plugin: not found user association esfahani
 sbatch: error: Batch job submission failed: Invalid account or account/partition combination specified
'
Could you please inform us how to solve this problem?

Thanks,
Ehsan
