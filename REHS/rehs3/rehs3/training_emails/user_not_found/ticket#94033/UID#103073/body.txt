Dear XSEDE help,

I just tried to submit a job and got the following error message:

sbatch: error: bank_limit plugin: not found user association sgozem
sbatch: error: Batch job submission failed: Invalid account or account/partition combination specified

It was working earlier today using the exact same submission script. Another member of my group got the same error message, so it seems my whole group is affected.

Even the following command is not working, giving the same error:
srun --partition=debug --pty --nodes=1 --ntasks-per-node=1 -t 00:30:00 --wait=0 --export=ALL /bin/bash

Any idea what the issue may be?

Thanks!
Samer
