Hi, I'm Youngwoo from Umich and I have been working with prof.Heather 
I've been trying to submit job on Comet. I've gotten error message like this. 

sbatch: error: bank_limit plugin: user is disallowed to submit jobs
sbatch: error: Batch job submission failed: Invalid account or account/partition combination specified

My PI added me and I've tried to type "show_accounts" : I have project "nwu150" and also I have available SUs. 

I don't know how to submit jobs. Could you help me? 

My best
Youngwoo
