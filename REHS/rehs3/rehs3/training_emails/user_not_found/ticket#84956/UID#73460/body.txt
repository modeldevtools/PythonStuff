Dear SDSC Support,

Recently it seems that my allocation on Comet has been reduced. Previously
I can have at most 10 jobs running at the same time, but now I can only
have 3. As soon as I submit the fourth job, I get the following two error
messages:

"sbatch: error: bank_limit plugin: not found user association wyf"

"sbatch: error: Batch job submission failed: Invalid account or
account/partition combination specified"

Could you please help me find out if something has changed? I am not aware
of any change made on my part. My account id is "wyf".

Thank you greatly!!

Best,
Yifei
