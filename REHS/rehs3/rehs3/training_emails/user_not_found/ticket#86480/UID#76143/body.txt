Hi,

From around noon today, I cannot submit job to comet. I got the following error messages:

sbatch: error: bank_limit plugin: not found user association paz008
sbatch: error: Batch job submission failed: Invalid account or account/partition combination specified

Could you help me with this? My user name is paz008

Thank you,
Pan
