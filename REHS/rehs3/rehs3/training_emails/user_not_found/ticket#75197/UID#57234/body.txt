Hello,

I'm trying to submit a job on Comet and am getting the following error: 

sbatch: error: bank_limit plugin: not found user association nng1
sbatch: error: Batch job submission failed: Invalid account or account/partition combination specified

I have remaining allocations on comet through TG-MCB110056. Any idea why this is happening?

Best,
Natalie
