Hey, I'm trying to submit jobs and I'm getting the following error.

sbatch: error: bank_limit plugin: not found user association rcw27
sbatch: error: Batch job submission failed: Invalid account or account/partition combination specified

It looks like I still have >40,000 SUs on comet, so I'm not really sure what I'm doing wrong. Can you offer any advice?

Thanks,

Rachel
