Hi there,

Suddenly I could not submit jobs, while I was able to a moment ago. It returns error as follows:
sbatch: error: bank_limit plugin: not found user association chenhe
sbatch: error: Batch job submission failed: Invalid account or account/partition combination specified

Could you help to check where goes wrong?

Thanks in advance.
He Chen
