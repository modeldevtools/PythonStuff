Hi,
I'm not able to submit code on comet. It gives the error, 
"sbatch: error: bank_limit plugin: not found user association kanika
sbatch: error: Batch job submission failed: Invalid account or account/partition combination specified"
However, I can see my account on the portal. Any ideas on why this could be happening?
