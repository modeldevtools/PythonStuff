Hi, 

I had submitted some jobs to Comet with codes which are all identical except some parameters. But I found some of them are running extremely slower than others. The job id of them are
SLURM Job_id=12297061 Name=r25e30n20k352e8
SLURM Job_id=12436775 Name=r40e40n20k352e8
Can you please check if any bad/broken node was accidentally used by these two jobs?

Thanks,
