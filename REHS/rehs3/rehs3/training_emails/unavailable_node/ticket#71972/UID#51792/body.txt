Dear Comet Helpdesk,

Hi!

I have been running the mapping and calling of the WGS data in our lab on comet this week. I have noticed that my jobs have been experiencing NODE_FAIL for several times. Can you help me investigate what is going on with these jobs or nodes? At the end of this email, I have a list of all the jobs that have experienced NODE_FAIL recently(two of them are from 6/29 and the others are from this week).

Thank you!

Best Regards,
Luna Lu
