Hi,

I'm currently trying to submit jobs to Comet CPU (Regular memory) queue.
Once submitted, I squeue the jobs and see the below text in the Nodelist
(reason) column:

(ReqNodeNotAvail,
UnavailableNodes:comet-01-[01-72],comet-04-49,comet-06-43,comet-14-[57-60],comet-16-67,comet-22-[10,46],comet-23-[63,66],comet-25-[21-24],comet-29-56,comet-30-03,comet-31-20)

I have not requested any specific nodes in my batch script. I have noticed
that other jobs in the queue also have this message. Is there a hold on the
compute nodes at the moment?
