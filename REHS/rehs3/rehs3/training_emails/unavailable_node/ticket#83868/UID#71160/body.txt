In the past Comet has provided CVMFS support for IceCube by mounting /cvmfs/icecube.opensciencegrid.org on the execute nodes.  I recently noticed that /cvmfs/icecube.opensciencegrid.org isn't available anymore.  I was wondering if we could get our CVMFS repo mounted again on the Comet execute nodes.  Thank you for your help!
