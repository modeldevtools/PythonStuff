Hi,

I hope you are doing well. I have submitted a job on COMET almost six 
hours ago asking for just one node (ID#: 15591572). This is the only job 
I have submitted since then, but it is still pending. Is COMET still 
experiencing some problems or this is just due to lack of resources 
currently available?

Thanks and Regards,

Mahdi
