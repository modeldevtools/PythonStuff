Hi,

I am trying to launch a simulation campaign which consists of 20 different
cases that is to be executed in a single batch session in a concurrent
manner.
For each of these cases I am trying to utilize 24 cores so I am requesting
20 nodes to run 20 cases with 24 cores for each of these cases.

So I have developed a script which will run a loop to go to each work
directory and then issue the ibrun command.
I can see first 10 cases launched and running ok but then when I checked
the 11th till 20th case, it shows the following in the stdio that I capture:

[agel@comet-ln3 Hopper]$ tail
/oasis/projects/nsf/azs121/agel/Hopper/Hopper_000001/sim_000010/run.20414588
*[comet-02-06.sdsc.edu:mpirun_rsh][child_handler] Error in init phase,
aborting! (0/20 mpispawn connections)*

Does it mean I ran out of nodes or ranks to launch the 11th and up
concurrent cases?

Attach below is an excerpt from my batch script file to show how this
concurrent launching is performed:
OUT_LIST is the file that I read where case numbers are listed for
execution as I have 60 cases so I create a batch of 20 to run at a time by
setting OUT_LIST to 20 different case names.
MFIX_ARGS0 stores the arguments that I pass to the executable at run time

#!/bin/csh
#SBATCH -J P2Hopper
#SBATCH -o P2LOG.%j.%N.out
#SBATCH --partition=compute
#SBATCH --nodes=20
#SBATCH --ntasks-per-node=24
#SBATCH -A TG-CTS160064
#SBATCH --export=ALL
#SBATCH -t 2:00:00
...
set NUMCores = 24
.... all other missing variables used in the loop are defined in this
region prior to calling them
...
....
   set OUT_LIST = `awk '{print $0}' $infiles2`
   foreach i ($OUT_LIST)
     echo "Launching Run No:" $i
     echo "Workdir: " $WORK_DIR/sim_$i
     cd $WORK_DIR/sim_$i
     cp -f -r $EXEPATH/$EXEFILE .
     (time ibrun -n $NUMCores ./${EXEFILE} -f hopper_cal.mfx ${MFIX_ARGS0}
>& run.$SLURM_JOBID) &
   end
wait

I can see that 20 different executions are submitted but anything above
10th has that error message so I am wondering if somehow the 20 nodes
allocated for the job are somehow not seen after the 10th job

Any suggestions on what I might be missing, as I don't want to split
further and submit in batches of 10 in each batch session

Thanks

Aytekin
