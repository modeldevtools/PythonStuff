Hi,
About 18-19 hrs back I submitted a job. I still see it is not yet started and I see the message in the below when I submit squeue -u anupb.   It looks like there are problems with processors. Also, I tried just now with fewer processors, and I see similar message.    Kindly let me know what is the problem and when I can submit the job successfully.

Thanks,
Anup.
