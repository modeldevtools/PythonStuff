Hello,



There’s what looks like a zombie job on  comet-25-38 node (SDSC Comet): an executable ‘athena’ (user yanfeij) is running on the node which is supposed to be used exclusively by my MPI job (submitted to the ‘compute’ queue), which is getting slowed down across all 14 nodes…



Thanks!



Cheers,

-Qadir
