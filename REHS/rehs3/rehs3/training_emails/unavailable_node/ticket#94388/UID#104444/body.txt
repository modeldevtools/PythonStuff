Hi,
When I squeue the compute partition, I see that my jobs (and numerous
others) have a Nodelist (Reason) of:
(ReqNodeNotAvail,
UnavailableNodes:comet-01-[38,55-72],comet-12-70,comet-14-06,comet-21-38,comet-23-17,comet-30-03,comet-33-[05,08])

My sbatch script does not specify which nodes that my job should run on.
Additionally, there seems to be over half of the compute partition sitting
idle (based on sinfo). Why are my jobs being held up in the queue?
