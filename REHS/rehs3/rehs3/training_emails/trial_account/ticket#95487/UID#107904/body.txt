Hi, I'm a researcher at Columbia University that is testing out XSEDE resources for biomolecular dynamics simulations using Amber. I've been given access to our university's test allocation but do not have access to the Comet GPUs, where Amber will probably be most useful to me. I'm told that Columbia should have test allocations with Comet and Comet GPUs but do not see this when I look at "My XSEDE" resources in the web interface. Please let me know what needs to be done to gain access to these allocations. Thanks.

Sincerely,

Neel Shah
