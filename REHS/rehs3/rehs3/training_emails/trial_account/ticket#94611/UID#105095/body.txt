Hi,

My lab is beginning a project that would need considerable computing resources, and we're inquiring if applying for a Startup allocation is suitable for our needs. I have also inquired the SDSC about whether a HPC@UC allocation would be more adequate. The project would require extensive storage space (~50 TB). Many terabytes of files would have to be transferred to the supercomputer from external hard drives. Can we find out how fast the speed of this type of transfer would be? Are we limited by the speed of our internet connection, or is there a way to physically transfer files to the supercomputer? The project would also require the installation of external softwares written in Python to the supercomputer. We would like to know what the maximum amount of storage we could request for this allocation is and whether installation of external softwares is possible. Thank you very much for your help.
