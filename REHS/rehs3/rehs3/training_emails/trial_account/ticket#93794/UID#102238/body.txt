Hi,

I would like to request a comet-GPU cluster trial account. I have a research award to do high-throughput brain connectomic analysis using brain imaging in Alzheimer's disease (TACC-Stampede2). Related to this existing xsede research project, I now plan to apply deep neural network to the image data using comet-GPU. Access to trial account will help us perform scalability testing on comet and prepare for a larger research award application later. Thanks for your consideration.


Best,
