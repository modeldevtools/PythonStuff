Hi,

I just created this account, and it appears that I have been incorrectly added to another's allocation on Comet. Can you please look into this and let me know?

The PI for the allocation is: Mahidhar Tatineni, and the allocation is: Comet Rapid Access Project | TG-ASC150024.

I am in the lab of Yingxiao (Peter) Wang, so this would only make sense to me if they had some sort of joint allocation.

Thanks,

Reed
