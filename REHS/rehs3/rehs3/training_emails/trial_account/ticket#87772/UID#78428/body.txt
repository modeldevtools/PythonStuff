[Category: Trial Account]
I am a computational research scientist working under the guidance of Prof. Jen-Mei Chang at  California State University, Long Beach (CSULB) to mentor Felix Alcantara, a master's student at CSULB.  Last week we were able to run a small test job but we were unable to run a Python script which requires Torch.  I am requesting a trial allocation account with GPU access in order to help Felix with troubleshooting. Our goal is to explore different network architectures for image classification of land use images.  Felix Alcantara is also interested in learning about HPC, and the skills he is obtaining in using the XSEDE cluster are relevant to internships he is applying to.  Since he is still taking courses and working toward his comprehensive exams, I would like to be able to be more supportive (in particular in making sure Torch and PyTorch are working so that they are ready for him to use).
