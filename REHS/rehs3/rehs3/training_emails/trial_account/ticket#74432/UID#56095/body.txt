[Category: Software]
To whom it may concern:

My name is Samuel Hwang and I am an undergraduate student at the University of California, Riverside studying computer science. I recently acquired an opportunity to assist Jon Spalding in his research in Condensed Matter Physics. His stack requires access to the COMET to execute programs. Since I am assisting him, may I have access to the COMET resources? Please let me know if you have any questions and thank you very much for your assistance. 

Best,
Samuel Hwang
