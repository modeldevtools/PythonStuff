[System: Comet]
[Category: Allocations]
Dear Sir or Madam:

I am seeking a COMET Trial allocation so that I may make some initial test runs in preparation for a larger research allocation proposal.

I am a former COMET user and most recently had an educational grant that just expired, as well as a research grant (several years ago), and thus already have an account set up.

I will also be contacting my Campus Champion today, but I am pretty sure they don't have SUs on Comet.

Thanks!

Matt Gilmore
