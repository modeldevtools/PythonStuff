Dear Reader,

I have open the #76853 ticket (consider it closed), after which analysis I'm able to submit the fallowing request:

Please be aware that I'm requesting the use of a trial account on the Comet. This trial account will help me understand the use of XSEDE platform by testing various bioinformatic tools and the procedures used to connect run and get the results from the server. 

Best of regards,
Ph.D. Candidate Mihai Ionita
