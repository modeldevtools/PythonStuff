Hi - I am a PhD student considering using the XSEDE resources for an image analysis project. I currently run these jobs on a workstation with 12 cores, but processing takes day so I am interested in moving things to compute cluster environment. I'd like to test it out then potentially apply for a startup allocation.

Thanks!
