[Ticket created from XUP by guest]
[From: Katherine Wilkin]
[System: Comet]
[Category: Trial Account]
I would like to enroll in a trial allocation for my user account, "katew", on comet. I am a UC Berkeley postdoc working with the California Air Resource Board to better predict wildfire emissions, and I will be moving positions to UC ANR in September while I continue working on this project. I am being advised by UC Berkeley's 	Cloud Computing helpers, including Aaron Culich <aculich@berkeley.edu> and <omuellerklein@berkeley.edu>.
