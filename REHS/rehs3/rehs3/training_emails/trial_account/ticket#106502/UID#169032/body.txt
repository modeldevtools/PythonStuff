[System: Comet]
[Category: Trial Account]
Hello,

I am a Ph.D. student in scientific computing group of University of Illinois. I am working on partial differential equation solvers using FMM-accelerated integral equation methods. I requested a trial allocation on Comet six months ago but it has recently expired. I still want to make some improvements on our software before moving on to a larger allocation. Could you give me another trial account for Comet? 

Thanks!
