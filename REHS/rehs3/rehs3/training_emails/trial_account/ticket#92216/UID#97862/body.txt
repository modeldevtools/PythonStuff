To whom it may concern,

I am an NSF Fellow interested in Comet's GPU resources, and I would like to apply for a Comet Trial Allocation before submitting a full Startup Request. I have attached my NSF Offer Letter here. Please let me know what other information you need from me to proceed. Thank you!

Best,
Melissa
