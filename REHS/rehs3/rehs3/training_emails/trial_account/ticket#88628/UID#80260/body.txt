Hello, 

I am beginning to apply for a startup allocation but have quantum chemical calculations I would like to run in the meantime. I read on a help page that I can apply for 1000 SU using a trial allocation while I complete the startup application. Is this the correct place to inquire about that? 

Thank you, 
Daniel
