Hi,

We have an active allocation (TG-DMR160007) on Comet (CPUs) and Stampede. However, we would like to try out the GPU version of an electron microscopy image simulation software: mu_STEM (http://tcmp.ph.unimelb.edu.au/mustem/muSTEM.html). 
I am wondering if its possible to get a trial allocation of 200 GPUs on Comet to compare the scaling of its GPU and CPU versions? If the GPU version is faster, we might then submit a request to change some of our CPU SUs to GPU.

Thank you.
