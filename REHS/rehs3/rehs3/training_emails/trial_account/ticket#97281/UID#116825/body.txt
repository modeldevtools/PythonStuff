Hello,

I was provided a trial allocation to Comet with project name SDS154. When I go to My XSEDE -> Allocations/Usage, I do not see this project listed. Instead, I see an allocation owned by Mahidhar Tatineni with project name TG-ASC150024. How can I gain access to SDS154 and can you remove me from Mahidhar Tatineni's allocation?

Thanks,

Drew
