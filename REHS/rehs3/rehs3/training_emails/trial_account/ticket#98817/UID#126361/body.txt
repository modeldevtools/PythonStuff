Hi there,

I'm new to XSEDE, so I'd like to try GPU capabilities of Comet first. 
Can you allocate me 1000 SUs with Trial Allocation for Comet option? 

I'm not sure how this Trial option works. Do I need to ask for resources using the other options, Startup, Research, etc. before using this Trial choice? 

It's very likely I'd ask for more resources using Startup option. Can I use those resources as soon as I finished using the Trial allocated resources?

Thank you.
Cristian Caranica
