[System: Comet]
[Category: Allocations]
I have a trial allocation on Comet. I am planning on submitting an XRAC proposal for the current cycle, and the allocation has been very useful.  In the course of running benchmarks, I ran into some bugs in the MPI libraries on Comet that only showed up with large jobs (see ticket #106608).  Unfortunately, getting to the bottom of these problems has used up my trial allocation.  Could I get a supplement to my allocation?  I think 500 SU's would be sufficient.
