Hi there,

As part of my transition away from Maverick as it is decommissioned, we would like to perform performance scaling testing on Comet GPU for accelerated NAMD simulations as part of our allocation renewal. I am seeking a Trial Allocation to perform the benchmarking. Please let me know if there's anything else you need from me to get the ball rolling on this.

Thanks,
Rob
