[Ticket created from XUP by rlehe]
[From: Remi Lehe]
[System: Comet]
[Category: Trial Account]
In order to prepare a proposal for a Startup allocation on Comet, I would like to confirm that the code that I intend to use can be properly installed and run on these resources.

The above-mentioned code is the open-source Particle-In-Cell code FBPIC (https://fbpic.github.io/). This code make efficient use on GPU, through the Numba library. However, I have occasionally (though rarely) experienced issues with Numba with some GPU systems/drivers. Having a trial account would allow me to confirm that there is no such issue on Comet.
