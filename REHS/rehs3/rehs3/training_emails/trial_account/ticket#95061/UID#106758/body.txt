Dear xsede team, 

I would like to request a trial allocation on comet and comet-gpu to evaluate our current project related to Bioinformatic RNA slicing， the data is large scale,  and may need powerful gpu to process it. 
We would like to submit a proposal after trial evaluating our model. 

Thanks a lot.
Best，
Zijun Zhang
