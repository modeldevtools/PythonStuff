Dear Sir/ Madam,
I would like to submit a request for the Comet Trial Allocations. I am working on a project that requires using Gaussian program to perform TD-DFT simulation, which could be done with the Comet system.  Please let me know if there's anything I should submit along with the request. 

Thank you,
Phuong
