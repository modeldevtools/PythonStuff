[From: Alessandro Peri]
[System: Comet]
[Category: Trial Account]
I would like to get started a trial account in Comet, to familiarise with the XSEDE HPC. I will also use the trial account to profile and study the scaling of my code in your platform. This will help me inform the request for a resource allocation.
