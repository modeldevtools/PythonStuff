To predict the safety-critical properties of halogenated hydrocarbons (HHCs), computational modeling of HHC combustion will be essential, but this is challenging because detailed kinetic combustion models often feature thousands of reactions and hundreds of intermediate species.  To create accurate HHC combustion models, the thermochemical parameters of many intermediate species must be calculated.  We are requesting a Trial account because the XSEDE's Comet cluster will improve our HHC combustion models by facilitating high-level quantum chemistry calculations of HHC combustion intermediates.
