I'm looking for some computer resource to simulate the two-phase slug flow  in a long pipe. We have run the same problem on our local workstation on a coarse mesh, the result is promising. now we want to find rome computer resource to carry out high resolution simulation, which will be better if we have more than 256 cores.
