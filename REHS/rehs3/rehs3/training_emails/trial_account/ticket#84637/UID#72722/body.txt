Hello,

I have just ran out of my allocation for the trial account on Comet. My advisor is currently working on acquiring time on Comet for our group, but in the meantime would it be possible to renew / allocate more SUs to my trial account? I have been working on testing our simulations for the GPUs, and would appreciate being able to finish up my testing in the meantime.

Thank you! We really appreciate the ability to use the Comet GPUs!

Best,
Ryan
