[System: Comet]
[Category: Trial Account]
Hello, 
In my research group we are running out of cpu time and we are evaluating new possibilities to get computing resources. Comet seems a suitable machine for our kind of simulations and I would like to have some trial cpu time to test our codes.

Thank you,
   Marco
