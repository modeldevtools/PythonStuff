Hi,

I would like to test Comet for some enhanced conformational sampling simulations before requesting a startup allocation. I will be testing standard molecular dyanmics simulation softwares such as Gromacs and NAMD and possibly the metadynamics plugin plumed. I am attaching a short document describing the overall project (abstract for our startup request).

Thanks,
Sai Pooja Mahajan
