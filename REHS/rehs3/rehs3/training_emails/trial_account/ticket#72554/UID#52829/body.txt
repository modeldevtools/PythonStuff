Hi,

I just used up my trial account of 1000 SU's. 

I am attempting to acquire a Startup Account 50,000 SU's through my research adviser. Until that is available, is it possible to extend my trial account? I was very close to finishing a set of calculations over the weekend but I ran out of time.

Thanks!

Jon
