[From: Bhavesh Patel]
[System: Comet]
[Category: Trial Account]
Hi,

I am Bhavesh Patel, Assistant Research Professor at the California Medical Innovations Institute (a nonprofit organization located in San Diego). I have an on-going project that requires high-performance computing using Abaqus and I am considering applying for a Startup allocation on Comet. I would like to obtain a trial allocation on Comet to conduct initial resource evaluation.

Thank you.
