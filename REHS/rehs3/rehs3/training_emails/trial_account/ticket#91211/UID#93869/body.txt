[Category: Trial Account]
I would like a trial account to benchmark results on Comet-GPU.  I will be submitting a proposal for a full allocation soon that involves creating data-driven material models, based on data computed by direct numerical simulation. I would like to use the GPUs on Comet to train the deep neural network based material model using TensorFlow.

Best,
Greg Teichert
