Hello,

I am writing to apply for trial allocations (with reference to the earlier mails sent by Christopher Churas with subject "Request to add new user to ddp140 project on comet ISSUE=18383 PROJ=7‚Äù).

I have created an XUP account yesterday (username bhsu) and according to the website, I am supposed to submit a ticket to the XSEDE Help desk.

Kindly let me know if there is anything else need on my side.

Thanks a lot,
Bailey
