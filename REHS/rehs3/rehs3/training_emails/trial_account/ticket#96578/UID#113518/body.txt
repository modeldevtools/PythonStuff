[Ticket created from XUP by mcapnspa]
[From: Margherita Capriotti]
[System: Comet]
[Category: Trial Account]
Hi, 
I am a UCSD Grad Student (PhD) in the Structural Engineering Department, doing research in Prof. Lanza di Scalea's NDE-SHM Lab.

I would like to run a job on the Comet system, since my application requires large memory to run. It is based on a series of Matlab scripts and my computer resources are not sufficient.

I have just created an account, please let me know how to proceed to test the code on the trial SUs.

Thank you,
Margherita
