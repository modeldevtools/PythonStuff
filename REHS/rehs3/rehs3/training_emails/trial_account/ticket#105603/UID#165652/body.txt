[From: Walter Landry]
[System: Comet]
[Category: Allocations]
I would like a trial allocation on Comet to benchmark a code for high energy physics that I am working on.

Simmons-Duffin, D. J. High Energ. Phys. (2015) 2015: 174. https://doi.org/10.1007/JHEP06(2015)174

In the past, I was associated with CIG, and I seem to have access to their allocations.  I have not been associated with them for over 5 years, so I should not be using their allocation.

Thank you.
