[Category: Trial Account]
Hello,

I would like to request a Trial account on the Comet system for computations for the ongoing research work at CENI - http://jacobsschool.ucsd.edu/ceni/. 
The title of the project is "Preliminary Compute Capability Analysis Targeting Biological Network". I'm an undergraduate student, working as a research assistant with CENI.

Thank you and Regards,
Arkin Gupta
