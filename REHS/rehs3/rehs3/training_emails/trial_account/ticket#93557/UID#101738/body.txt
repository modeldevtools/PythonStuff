[Category: Trial Account]
Hello,

I am a graduate student in scientific computing group of University of Illinois. I am working on partial differential equation solvers using FMM-accelerated integral equation methods. Recently, I have extended the implementation to distributed-memory machines based on MPI. The software has been tested on my research group's small-scale cluster with dozens of cores and shows promising scalability. I would like to request a trial account on Comet to future benchmark my implementation.

Thanks!
