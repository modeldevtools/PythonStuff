Hello,

I am a graduate student at the UCSD economics department. I am working with Prof. Allan Timmermann at the Rady School of Management on a finance project. We would like to apply for a trial account to access 1000 Comet SUs and 100 Comet GPU SUs to test out the system for running our Tensorflow and Python scripts. 

Thank you.

Best regards,
Linyan Zhu
