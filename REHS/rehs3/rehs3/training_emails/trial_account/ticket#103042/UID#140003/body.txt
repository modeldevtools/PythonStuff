Hi,

I am a newly-hired assistant professor in organic chemistry at the New Jersey Institute of Technology. I would like to obtain a Comet trial account. This will allow me to test the computing power of Comet to run Gaussian calculations on large catalytic systems.

Thank you,

Pier Alexandre Champagne
