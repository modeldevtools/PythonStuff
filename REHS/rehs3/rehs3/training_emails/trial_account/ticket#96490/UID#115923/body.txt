Hi there,

I have two types of allocations under my account (username: zhly90), one recently-approved startup and the other trial. I have two questions regarding switching projects. I would greatly appreciate it if you could help me with them.

1. The startup allocations include 500GB oasis storage. Does it mean that my oasis location (/oasis/scratch/comet/zhly90/temp_project) which I have used with my trial allocations now has 500GB storage and can be accessed by both projects?

2. I am not able to see the balances of my trial and startup GPU allocations with the show_accounts command. Could you please let me know how to check them from the command line?

Thank you.

Best regards,
Linyan Zhu
