Hi,

I would like to apply for a trial account with the intention of performing preliminary gpu-accelerated molecular dynamics calculations pertinent to my research project.

I am a graduate student at Caltech and my research is purely academic.

Please let me know if I need to provide any additional information.

Cheers,
Stefan
