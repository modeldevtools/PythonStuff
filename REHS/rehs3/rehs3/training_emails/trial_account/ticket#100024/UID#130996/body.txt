Hello.

I'd like to request a trial access to SDSC Comet GPU cluster. I am developing a platform called https://brainlife.io and I'd like to see if this cluster can be used to submit some of our GPU enabled Apps (I believe we can, but just to be sure). We are also requesting XSEDE research allocation for 2019 with a limited amount of Comet-GPU SU.

Thank you!
