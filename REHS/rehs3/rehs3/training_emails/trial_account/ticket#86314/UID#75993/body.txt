[Ticket created from XUP by marthac]
[From: Martha Constantinou]
[System: Comet]
[Category: Trial Account]
Dear users support, 
I am the PI of the project #TG-PHY170022 and I am preparing for renewal.

I would like to test the performance of our codes on Comet (standard CPUs) 
and I ask for a trial account to be granted to the project participant Colin Lauer
(user cjlauer).

Thank you in advance,
Martha
