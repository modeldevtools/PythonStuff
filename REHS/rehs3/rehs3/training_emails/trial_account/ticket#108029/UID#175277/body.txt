Hello,

My name is Elynn, and I'm a graduate student at UCSD. Our lab is in the process of evaluating our options for running CFD simulation. The code we're working with has been implemented in CUDA for GPU support. We would like to test a case in Comet GPU (using just one GPU) and evaluate the performance. Additionally, I was wondering if there's a help desk on UCSD campus that I can come by and ask specific questions about setting up the simulation.

Thank you!
