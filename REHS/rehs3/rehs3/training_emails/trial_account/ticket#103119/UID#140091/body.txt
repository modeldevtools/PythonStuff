[Ticket created from XUP by benbo81]
[From: Benjamin Langmead]
[System: Comet]
[Category: Allocations]
I would like to request a Comet trial allocation.  I understand the trial allocation will be for 1,000 SUs for 6 months.  From my reading of the instructions -- at https://portal.xsede.org/allocations/startup -- I believe I should make this request via this help desk ticket:

"To apply for a Trial Allocation on Comet, create an XSEDE User Portal (XUP) account. Once you have your XUP account, please submit a ticket to the XSEDE Help Desk."

Thank you for your help,
Ben
