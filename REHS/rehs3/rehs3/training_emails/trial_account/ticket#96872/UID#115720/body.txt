Hi Mahidhar,

My projects may need to use distributed computation over comet GPU. Specifically, I would like to leverage pytorch distributed packages here
https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/distributed.html#basics
An example to use this to train on ImageNet is here:
https://github.com/pytorch/examples/blob/master/imagenet/main.py

Do you have any idea about setting this up on comet? It may be quite complicated as we host data on another node and use singularity container.

Thanks,
Yu
