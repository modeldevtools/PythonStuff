Hello,

I am a current undergraduate at the University of Michigan studying Chemistry. I am interested in getting a trial allocation for the Comet Cluster. My PI learned of XSEDE a few weeks ago at a conference, and we were interested in exploring it and seeing if it could be of potential use to our research. The research I am assisting with is using GAMESS to predict UV/Vis Spectrum for flavins with different substituents and in different solvents. This is in an effort to be able to systematically predict effects on spectra based on environmental changes. Would I be able to get a Comet trial allocation so that I may evaluate the resource and see if it is something that we may want to use in the future? If you need any other information, please let me know!

Thank you,
