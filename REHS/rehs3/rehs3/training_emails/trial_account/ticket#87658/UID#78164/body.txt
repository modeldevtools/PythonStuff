[System: Comet]
[Category: Trial Account]
Hello, 

I am a Phd student at the Computational Science Research Center in SDSU, i have worked in Comet and Bridges before, around a year ago, and i would like to request a trial account again to make some benchmark, scaling and performance test in our model, the General Curvilinear Coastal Ocean Dynamics model, GCCOM. 

Since last year, when i benckmarked the pressure solver performance, we have ported the rest of the model to PETSc for domain distribution and linear solvers, we now are in the writing stage to publish our results and part of the work is to remake our results in a proven machine, as Comet.

Thanks for your help,

Manuel Valera
