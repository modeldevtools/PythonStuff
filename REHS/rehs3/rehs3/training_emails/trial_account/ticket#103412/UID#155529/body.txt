[Category: Trial Account]
Hi,

My request to obtain a trial account on Comet has been rejected because help desk was unable verify my association with the California Medical Innovations Institute and the non-profit status of my Institute. Could you please let me know how I could help verify these two queries? I am an Assistant Research Professor at the California Medical Innovations Institute (a non-profit 501-c) and researchers from our Institute have previously received access to Comet so I believe we qualify. I have attached the Federal Tax Board Exempt Letter for our Institute. Please let me know if you need anything else.

Best,

Bhavesh
