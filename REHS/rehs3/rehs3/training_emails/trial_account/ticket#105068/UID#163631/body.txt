[System: Comet]
[Category: Trial Account]
Hello,

I see that we can request a trial account on Comet. I am mainly interested in running a few test jobs with the Q-Chem program, which is not on Stampede2 (my main account) but seems to be on Comet. Is there a site-wide license for Q-Chem on Comet, or must I have my own personal license to use it? If it's the former, would it be possible to get a trial account on Comet? If it's the latter, I don't need to try out Comet at this time.

Thanks,
Andrew
