Dear XSEDE team

I would like to request a trial allocation on Comet of 1,000 SUs for 6 months.
We would like to use VASP for band structure calculations using the GW approximation, which requires a lot of computing power.
I attached the funded NSF proposal for your evaluation. 
NSF grant title: SHF: Medium: Collaborative Research: Atomic scale to circuit modeling of emerging nanoelectronic devices and adapting them to SPICE simulation package
NSF grant number: CCF 1514089
Thank you for your consideration.

Best regards
Michael N. Leuenberger
