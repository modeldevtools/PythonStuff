Dear XSede,
 
We would like to request a trial account on SDSC Comet to evaluate the
system for a startup allocation proposal. The current project is deep-learning based clinical analysis, Gpu is needed to for the model.  

If possible, could we get trial access to both comet and comet-gpu?

Thank you.
Best,
Jiaen Kuang
