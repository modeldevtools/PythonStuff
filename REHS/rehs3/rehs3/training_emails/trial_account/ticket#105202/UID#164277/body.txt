[Ticket created from XUP by khaatvei]
[From: Kersti Caddell Haatveit]
[System: Comet GPU]
[Category: Trial Account]
I would like to request a trial account on the Comet GPU cluster in order to perform benchmark studies to ultimately make a request for start up allocations. 

While my research group currently has research allocations, they are all on CPU clusters.
