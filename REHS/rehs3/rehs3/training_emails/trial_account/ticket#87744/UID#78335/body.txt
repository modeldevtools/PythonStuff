[Ticket created from XUP by dhg]
[From: David Gay]
[System: Comet]
[Category: Trial Account]
I attended the SDSC Big Data Science Workshop at UCSB yesterday (April 26) and I would like to request a trial account on Comet to work more carefully through the examples and to explore the machine learning and deep learning toolkits that are available.
