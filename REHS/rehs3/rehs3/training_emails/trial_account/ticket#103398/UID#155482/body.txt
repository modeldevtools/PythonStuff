Hi,

I would like to get a trial account on the comet HPC to do some benchmarking of our code.
We are planning to request a startup allocation soon based on those tests.

Our research deals with the oxidation of carbon materials as it happens for example on heatshields during high speed flight. For this we are performing kinetic Monte Carlo simulations on the atomic scale to understand the fundamental process of graphene oxidation. To scale this up, we need to run our simulations on larger domains. That is why we are now looking into hpc, and we hope we can make use of the resources of XSEDE in the future.

Best regards,
Simon Schmitt
