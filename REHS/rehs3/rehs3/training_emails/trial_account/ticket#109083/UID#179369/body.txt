[System: Comet]
[Category: Trial Account]
Hello,

I'm a Postdoctoral Scholar at the University of Chicago.  I'm investigating computational resources for a project I have on cosmic ray transport in the interstellar medium of the Milky Way galaxy.  I am interested in testing my code on Comet in a trial allocation, so see if it compiles and how it deals with mpi buffers.  The code I am using is an astrophysical hydrodynamics code called AREPO (Springel 2010, https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/401/2/791/1147356).  The simulations I am testing are an extension of work I have previously published in the Astrophysical Journal (https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2041-8205/827/2/L29/meta).

Thank-you
Christine Simpson
