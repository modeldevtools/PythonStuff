[Category: Trial Account]
I would like to test the scaling of a modified version of dHybrid (a kinetic hybrid plasma simulation code being used to study astrophysical shocks) in order to submit a research allocation request.

I already have a XSEDE user name: colbych from when I was a graduate student.
