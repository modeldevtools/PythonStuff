Hello.

I have some urgent computational jobs to run with a tool (https://engineering.purdue.edu/gekcogrp/software-projects/nemo5/) which the tool developers suggest we use on Comet. 

As a result, may I request a trial account on Comet in order to test it quickly to see if it fits my need? 

Thanks!
