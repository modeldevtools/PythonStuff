Hi,

I recently obtained a start-up allocation on Comet GPU (project TG-PHY180056), with 2500 SU. 

However, when running `show_accounts`, I see the following output:

ID name      project      used     available    used_by_proj
------------------------------------------------------------
rlehe        sds154       1        1000         26228   

This does not seem to correspond to this start-up allocation, but rather to a trail account on Comet that I obtained earlier.

Should I modify something in order to see the start-up allocation when running `show_projects`?

Thanks in advance for your help,
