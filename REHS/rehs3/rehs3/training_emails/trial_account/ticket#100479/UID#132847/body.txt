Greetings,

I have used up the vast majority of the core hours on my trial account at
gmooers@comet.sdsc.xsede.org and I was wondering if it would be possible
for me to receive another trial accounts worth of hours to the account? Or
if not, is there another process by which I can acquire additional hours
for the account?

Thank you,
Griffin
