[From: Justin Laughlin]
[System: Comet]
[Category: Trial Account]
Hello, I am a PhD student in the Rangamani lab at UC San Diego. I am running finite element simulations of biophysical models and would like to be granted a trial account so that I can test that my work will run on the comet framework. I was told by Matthias Haberl who is affiliated with the NCMIR and CRBS that I can use their hours to conduct my simulations. Thank you!
