Per the online process, I am requesting trial access to the Comet GPU system.

SDSC also offers Trial Allocations on its Comet cluster. Trial Allocations are designed to give potential users rapid, but limited access to the Comet resource. Trial allocations are 1,000 SUs for 6 months, sufficient for initial resource evaluation, giving new users the ability to compile and run software, and evaluate results. Within one business day, users will be able to log on and evaluate the Comet system prior to requesting a larger Startup or Research allocation.
