[System: Comet]
[Category: Trial Account]
We wish to run MD simulations on human phosphoglucose isomerase, wild type and six variants. We have biochemical data showing that variants with mutations at distal position show substantially lower catalytic activity. We wish to explore whether these variants have altered dynamics. We will use the trial to benchmark the amount needed to complete the simulations on the seven structures. This is a large dimeric protein and we need comet's speed. Comet also has MD software available.  Thanks,
