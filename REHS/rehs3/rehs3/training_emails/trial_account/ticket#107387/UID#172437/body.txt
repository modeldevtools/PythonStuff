[System: Comet]
[Category: Trial Account]
I would like to test out the Xsede system for research in plant genetics.  I am currently a graduate student at Cornell University researching the improvement of cassava for sub-Saharan Africa.  Is it possible to have a trial access to the comet system?
Thank you,
Evan Long
