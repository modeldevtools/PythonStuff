[Category: Trial Account]
I am interested in a trial account on SDCS Comet.  I work in data management (DM) in the optimal astronomy projects  Dark Energy Survey (DES) and LSST, and interested in testing the support for Singularity on Comet amongst other things (attended the recent presentation on Comet + Singularity).
