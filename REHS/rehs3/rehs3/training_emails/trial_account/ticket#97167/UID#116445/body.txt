Hi,

I thought I had a trial account on Comet but am experiencing this symptom when I try to access a node interactively:

[mpritcha@comet-ln3 ~]$ show_accounts
ID name      project      used     available    used_by_proj
------------------------------------------------------------

No accounts found for user mpritcha on platform sdsc_comet.


Can you help me understand the issue?

Thanks,

Mike.
