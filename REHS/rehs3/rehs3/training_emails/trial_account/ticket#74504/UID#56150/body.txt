Hello,

Before applying for a large allocation, I would like to request for the trail allocation. I am an existing user to STAMPEDE. I have used the resources while I was a graduate student. Now, I am a postdoc at UTK. Please let me know if need to submit any further documents. 

Thank you. 

Sincerely,
Takat Rawal, PhD
