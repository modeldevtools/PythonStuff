Dear XSEDE,

We are group of researchers at University of Michigan working on open-source code development of real-space DFT code (quantum chemistry code) using finite-element basis (DFT-FE). This code enables large-scale DFT runs reaching 50,000 - 100,000 electrons and tested up to 50,000 cores. You can visit https://sites.google.com/umich.edu/dftfe/home for more details. Currently, we have a pre-release version which is undergoing testing and we will release it to public in a week or two. Our code relies on dealii (https://dealii.org/) installed together with petsc and slepc and further uses scalapack as well.

Installation of these libraries with the correct compiler settings is always a herculean task and users interested in using our code might face issues installing the dependencies required for our code to run. To this end, we are wondering if there is a common space on Comet, where we can install all the dependencies required for our code where every xsede user can access. This will really help us to grow the user community base faster without their time getting wasted on installing the required dependencies for our code.
