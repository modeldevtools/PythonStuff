Dear Sir/Madam, 

Hope everything is well. 
We would like to try the comet-gpu allocation on our current project which is unsupervised learning of generative models. The project is computation intensive, and the powerful GPUs would offer great acceleration and make it easy to scale up to very large dataset. 

You invaluable help is well appreciated. 
Best,
Bo Pang
