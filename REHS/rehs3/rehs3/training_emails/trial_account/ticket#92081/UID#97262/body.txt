Hello,

I have 100,000 SUs for project "TG-MSS170004". This is approved for advance request of my renewal proposal. But I can not see available resources on Comet cluster through the command "show_accounts". I cannot run jobs neither. 

Could you please help me take a look? Thanks. Have a nice weekend.

Best,
Teng
