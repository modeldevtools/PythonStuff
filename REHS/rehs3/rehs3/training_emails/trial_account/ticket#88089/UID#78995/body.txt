?Hi,


I was planning to use COMET for simulations of a protein mostly using AMBER on GPU's. I was wondering if there is a trial allocation available before we write a start up request for allocation.

Can you please let me know if there is an availability for GPU/CPU trial allocation?


Thank you !!
