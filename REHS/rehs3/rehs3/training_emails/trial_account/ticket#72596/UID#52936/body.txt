Dear Sir or Madam,
I have crated an account on xsede. While I am working on an allocation proposal 
I would like to use the free trial. I am trying to connect to comet.sdsc.xsede.org.
I put ssh zahra83@comet.sdsc.xsede.org but it dose not allow me to connect.
It does not accept my password.
Could you please help me with that.

Best regards,
Zahra
