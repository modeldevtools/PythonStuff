[System: Comet]
[Category: Trial Account]
We use large-eddy simulations to study turbulent flows and scalar transport over complex terrain. Due to the large computational resources needed by large-eddy simulations, we try to use the HPC resources on Comet. At the starting point, we are requesting a trial account to see how it works on this HPC system. A detailed proposal will be uploaded later after the tests.
