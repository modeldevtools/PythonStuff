[From: Jeremy Hilgar]
[System: Comet]
[Category: Trial Account]
My group is interested in performing ab initio calculations on small molecules that we synthesize in our lab. We wish to ascertain whether or not these calculations can be setup and performed on Comet without too much hassle.

We feel a trial account should do the trick until we're ready for something more!
