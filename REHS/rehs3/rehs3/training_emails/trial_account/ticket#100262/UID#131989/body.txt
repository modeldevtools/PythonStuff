[Ticket created from XUP by noahbr]
[From: Noah Brenowitz]
[System: Comet]
[Category: Trial Account]
I am postdoc at the University of Washington, and I would like to evaluate how suitable XSEDE is for my current project. This project involves training neural networks to predict the unresolved processes in a model of the Earth's atmosphere. 

I expect that Comet would be a great resource for this project, so I was excited when I saw that I could request a trial allocation so easily.

Thanks!
