[Ticket created from XUP by ajacobs]
[From: Adam Jacobs]
[System: Comet]
[Category: Trial Account]
I am carrying out a simulation suite of many (initially 100s, planned to scale up to 1000s) serial jobs.  I am reaching the limit of what my local computing resources can handle and would like to explore how my suite runs on Comet, which seems like a good fit for my use-case (relatively modest scale for HPC, many independent serial jobs instead of a few large jobs requiring communication across nodes).  If the suite runs well on the trial allocation, I would then write a proposal for a more substantive allocation (on the order of a few hundred thousand CPU hours).
