Hi 

We had an allocation on Comet last year, but do no have an allocation on Comet this year. Can we still log into and access our data on Comet? Or do we need to maintain an active allocation on Comet in order to access our data? If so, can I transfer a small number of SUs to Comet to do this?

Thanks,
Deepti
