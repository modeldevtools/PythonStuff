Recently, we have investigated resolution requirements and boundary representation for the simulation of Reynolds number flow over airfoils that are relevant to micro-aerial vehicles. With growing computational resources, this type of simulation has become feasible. In 2D simulation, we showed that the precise representation of wall boundaries is of great importance for the capturing of essential flow features such as skin friction evolution and wake development. In ongoing work, we are performing DNS of 3D airfoil flows and validating it with parallel conducted experiments. Follow-on simulations will be on flow controlled airfoil simulations.
