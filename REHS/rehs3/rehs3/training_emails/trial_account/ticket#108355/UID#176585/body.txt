I develop assistive technology to help disabled individuals control a computer by voice. My current project (silvius, voxhub.io) is to allow computer programmers to write code by voice. I am integrating with existing software (Dragonfly) and training new speech models customized for voice coding. Fairly significant GPU resources are required for machine learning model training. All research code and models will be released open source and freely available. Thank you for your attention.
