[System: Comet]
[Category: Trial Account]
Hello, I would like to request a trail account on Comet. For my research I use Athena to perform 3D radiative-hydrodynamic simulations of exoplanets undergoing atmospheric escape. I have plans on using XSEDE resources to perform these simulations, and would like to start with a trail allocation on Comet.
