Hello,

      A year ago, I had Mahidhar set me up with permission to run some very small (i.e. only 1 node) jobs on Comet.  I guess when I got my XSEDE allocation renewed, this was not set up with my accounts (both ucr121 and ucr124 accounts).  Please see attachment for a similar issue last year.

      Can someone please enable this one-week job capability for both ucr121 and ucr124 for me?

Thanks,
Prof. Bryan Wong
