[From: Alan Shenkerman]
[System: Comet GPU]
[Category: Trial Account]
To Whom it May Concern,

I am an undergraduate student at Duke University working in the IPHD (International Population, Health and Development) Lab run by Professor Duncan Thomas. I would like to request a trial account for Comet GPU. The lab is working on an intensive machine learning application involving deep convolutional neural networks, and we need access to powerful GPU compute nodes that Comet can provide. We would appreciate the opportunity to try out Comet GPU for a few runs of our model, and if it proves compatible with our project, we would potentially move forward and request a larger allocation on the cluster. Thank you for considering this trial request.

Sincerely,

Alan Shenkerman
