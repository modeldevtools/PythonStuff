[Category: Trial Account]
Hello, I would like to request a trial account on COMET to run test simulations with the Weather Research and Forecasting model in preparation for a future proposal and larger resource request.  We ultimately plan to run high-resolution thunderstorm simulations to evaluate microphysical processes related to lightning in large thunderstorm complexes.
