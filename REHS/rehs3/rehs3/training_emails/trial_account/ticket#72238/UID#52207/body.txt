We recently proposed an iterative method, SCALE, for noninvasively estimating head tissue (in particular, skull) conductivity values and brain source distributions simultaneously using (1) a realistically shaped finite element method (FEM) head model constructed from a subject MR head image and (2) the scalp maps of 10â€“30 near-dipolar EEG source processes compatible with a single cortical patch source distribution, identified by Independent Component Analysis (ICA) decomposition of a sufficient amount and quality of high-density EEG data collected in any experimental condition (Akalin Acar, 2016). Our aim in this project is to implement SCALE in parallel, and test and apply it on 100 subjects. With this trial account, I will explore the SU and memory requirements to run SCALE.
