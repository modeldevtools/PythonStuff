Our school doesn't provide the super computer with GPU. Thus, we plan to built up a cluster in our lab and we need to test performances before we buy it. Our project is about the hydrodynamic simulation applied on accretion disks, I will use COMET-GPU to run FARGO3D (http://fargo.in2p3.fr/) for testing.
