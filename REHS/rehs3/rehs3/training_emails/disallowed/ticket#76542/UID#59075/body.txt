Dear Madame/Sir,

I have a problem submitting new jobs on comet! When I submit the sbatch file, I receive the error copied below:

sbatch: error: Batch job submission failed: Invalid account or account/partition     combination specified

I would appreciate if you could help me fix this problem at your earliest convenience!

Also, how can I change my contact email in Xsede?

Please find attached my .sb file!

Thanks,

Tadeh
