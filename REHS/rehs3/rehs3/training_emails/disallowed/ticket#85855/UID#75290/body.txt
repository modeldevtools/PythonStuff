Hello,

I'm a new Comet user. I'm added to the project # TG-MCB120014. I get the following errors when I try to submit my sbatch job. 

sbatch: error: bank_limit plugin: user is disallowed to submit jobs
sbatch: error: Batch job submission failed: Invalid account or account/partition combination specified

Can you please help me with that ?


Thanks,
Arjun
