Hi,

When I submit jobs, I get the following error message:

sbatch: error: bank_limit plugin: user is disallowed to submit jobs
sbatch: error: Batch job submission failed: Invalid account or account/partition combination specified

I created a similar ticket for help ([tickets.xsede.org #90394]) two weeks ago, and it was once fixed and it had been working until the end of last week.  

Could you help me again?
