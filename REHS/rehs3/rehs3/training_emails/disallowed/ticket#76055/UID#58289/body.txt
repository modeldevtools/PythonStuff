Hi:

I was trying to submit a job on Comet, and got the following message with a submission failure

There was an error running the SLURM sbatch command.
The command was:
'/usr/bin/sbatch comet_qsub.bat  2>&1'
and the output was:
'sbatch: error: bank_limit plugin: user is disallowed to submit jobs
 sbatch: error: Batch job submission failed: Invalid account or account/partition combination specified
'

I checked my account and found my allocation is still active. I am attaching my submitting file below:

#!/bin/bash
#SBATCH -A TG-CDA100010
#SBATCH --partition=compute
#SBATCH --nodes=1
#SBATCH --ntasks-per-node=24
#SBATCH -t 00:30:00
#SBATCH --job-name="1node_test"
#SBATCH -o %j.out
#SBATCH -e %j.err
#SBATCH --export=ALL
#SBATCH --mail-type=ALL
#SBATCH --mail-user taosun.victor@gmail.com

module unload mvapich2_ib
module load openmpi_ib
module load vasp

cd $SLURM_SUBMIT_DIR
export SLURM_NODEFILE=`generate_pbs_nodefile`

mpirun -hostfile $SLURM_NODEFILE -np 24 vasp > S4to5_02_vib.stdout

Thanks very much!
