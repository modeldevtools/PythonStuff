Greetings,
I am getting error messages about permissions being denied to my UCB152 and
UCB176 accounts. For example,

SLURM email:
SLURM Job_id=10781565 Name=test_ucb152 Failed, Run time 00:00:01, FAILED,
ExitCode 126
SLURM error message:
/var/spool/slurmd/job10781565/slurm_script: line 26: ./run_script.2003.sh:
Permission denied

Best,
Kate
