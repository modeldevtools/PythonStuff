Hello, logging this morning it seems I cant submit jobs anymore as I get this error: 

srun: error: bank_limit plugin: user is disallowed to submit jobs
srun: error: Unable to allocate resources: Invalid account or account/partition combination specified

im using this command: 

srun --partition=compute --pty --nodes=2 --ntasks-per-node=24 -t 02:00:00 --wait=0 --export=ALL /bin/bash

I should have plenty of allocation and I was just using this yesterday and everything was working fine

thank you.
