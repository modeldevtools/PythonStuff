Hello,

I just had my start-up allocation renewed for project TG-ATM170002 (cob130), but I am still getting this error when I try to submit a job, even though my user portal says I have 50,000 SUs available. Is there a waiting period for my renewal to actually take effect?

sbatch: error: bank_limit plugin: user is disallowed to submit jobs

Thank you,
Jessica
