Dear Sir / Madam,

I haven't been able to submit jobs onto Comet cluster for 2 days. When I tried to submit jobs this morning, I get the following error:

sbatch: error: bank_limit plugin: user is disallowed to submit jobs
sbatch: error: Batch job submission failed: Invalid account or account/partition combination specified

When I check my profile online, I see that I have 20 more days to use the cluster and I am not close to finishing to use my allocated time.

Thanks a lot for your help.

Best,
Emre Turkoz
