Dear all,
      I could not submit my jobs on comet gpu, the output is following:
There was an error running the SLURM sbatch command.
The command was:
'/usr/bin/sbatch run.2.pbs  2>&1'
and the output was:
'sbatch: error: bank_limit plugin: user is disallowed to submit jobs
 sbatch: error: Batch job submission failed: Invalid account or account/partition combination specified
     I have checked the SUs in the web (https://portal.xsede.org/group/xup/allocations/usage), it seems that there are some SUs remained. Is the numbers in the web not correct?
