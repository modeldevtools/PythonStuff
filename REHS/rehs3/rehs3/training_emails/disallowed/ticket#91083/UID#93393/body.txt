Error:
sbatch: error: bank_limit plugin: user is disallowed to submit jobs

I was wondering why I can no longer submit jobs and how/if I can regain permission.

I also received this error:
sbatch: error: Batch job submission failed: Invalid account or account/partition combination specified

If this is Marty, thank you so much for all your help in the past. I have submitted a successful job thanks to you and I am really grateful. :)
