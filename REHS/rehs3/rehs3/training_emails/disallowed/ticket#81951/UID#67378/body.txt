Hello,

I tried submitting jobs on Comet, but I got the following error:

sbatch -A prd130 --nodes=1 --ntasks-per-node=4 -t 48:00:00 --export=ALL /share/apps/gpu/interactive/_interactive
sbatch: error: bank_limit plugin: user is disallowed to submit jobs
sbatch: error: Batch job submission failed: Invalid account or account/partition combination specified

Is there some information missing in the command or am I using the wrong account number?

Thanks,
Harshad
