Hello.

I'm a postdoc, and I have recently been awarded a startup allocation. I'm going to use it for an independent research project as far as my PI is concerned. I plan to use the VASP and Gaussian packages, which my current group doesn't have access.

I don't know if this is feasible as VASP and Gaussian are paid software.
Is it a problem if I use the versions installed on Comet? (  vasp/5.4.4   and gaussian/16.B.01)

Thanks!
