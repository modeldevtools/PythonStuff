Hi,
I am trying to use vasp_vtst, and here is part of my vasp.sb.
export MODULEPATH=/share/apps/compute/intelmpi/bin:$MODULEPAT
module unload intel
module load vasp

But it reports:
/var/spool/slurmd/job13434457/slurm_script: line 17: mpirun: command not found

What is the right way to load the module or do I miss something in the vasp.sb? Thank you.
