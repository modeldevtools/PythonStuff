Dear XSEDE technical stuff,

I'm Yanzhou from Penn State, a user on Comet under allocation TG-DMR170006. Now some of my simulation tasks require first-principle calculations, which relies on the software package VASP. I am a user of a shared (group) VASP license on our local clusters at Penn State. Could you please let me know that, if I would like to run VASP on Comet, what should I do for the license agreement, and how can I access the VASP program?

Thanks a lot!


Yanzhou Ji
