Dear Sir or Madam,

We would like to update the user list for VASP for our group (PI : Prof. Jeffrey C. Grossman). Currently, three people from our group will use VASP (everyone should already be on the VASP license for our group). Our VASP license number is 5-725. 
There is one new user : Arthur France-Lanord (afl).
The other two users are myself, Eric Fadel (efadel) and Yun Liu (liuyun) who were previously already on the user list.

Thanks,

Eric Fadel
