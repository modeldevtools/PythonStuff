Hello:

I am a new PhD student, so I am not too familiar with HPC computing. I am currently trying to run a test VASP job on COMET. I have tried to use the vasp.sb example that is under /share/apps/examples to run my job. 

After unloading intel and loading vasp,I keep getting "/usr/bin/which: no vasp_std" with the command 'which vast_std'. 

I have tried to source the /share/apps/sys/vasp_update.sh, but I get permission denied. I have also tried to look into the /share/apps/compute/vasp/ directory and get permission denied. 

I am not sure what I need to do to get a vasp job running. Could you help me?

Thank you,
