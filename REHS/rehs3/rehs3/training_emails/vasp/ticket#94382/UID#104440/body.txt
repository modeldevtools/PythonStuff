Dear Concern,

Following is the link of BEEF functional, which I compiled with vasp.5.4.4 in CASCADE and HYPERION clusters.

https://confluence.slac.stanford.edu/display/SUNCAT/BEEF+Functional+Software

I would like to compile vasp with libbeef in COMET. In that case, I need a makefile that is compatible for compilation in COMET. I have attached the makefile that I have used for compile libbeef with vasp 5.4.4 in HYPERION cluster.
Please obliged me by sending a makefile for compiling libbeef with vasp.5.4.4 in COMET.
