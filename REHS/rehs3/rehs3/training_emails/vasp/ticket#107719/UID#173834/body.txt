To whom it may concern,

I am Yanqing Su, a PI of a new startup allocation on XSEDE (MSS190006). I
would like to run VASP on Comet. Could you please help me with this? I tried 'module load vasp' but then could not find it by 'which vasp'.

My postdoc advisor, Prof. Beyerlein at UCSB, has bought VASP, with license
number 5-2968. If you check with VASP, they will have my name under this
license number as a member of the Beyerlein group.

Thanks
Yanqing
