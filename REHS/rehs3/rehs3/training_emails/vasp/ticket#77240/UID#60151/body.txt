Dear Comet Staff,

I am trying to run VASP in Comet using MPI, but every result was outputted
by 24 times in the output file, so I think my script should not be correct.
I have tried all the MPI methods listed on the website, but none got run.
Do you have any example script for running VASP in Comet?

Here is my script:

module load vasp/5.4.4
VASP=$(which vasp)
export SLURM_NODEFILE=`generate_pbs_nodefile`
mpirun_rsh -hostfile $SLURM_NODEFILE -np 24 $VASP >out.txt


Many thanks,
Tianli
