Dear XSEDE Reader,


I want to run VASP vasp.5.4.4 on Stampede2, in multiprocessor mode.

Stampede2 is not up and running, so I'd like to do it on Comet, then scp

it to Stampede2.


I've loaded the src-files onto Comet, but I'm not sophisticated about compiling

it in a form that is optimized for Stampede2.


Can you give me an optimized makefile?


Thanks,

Ben
