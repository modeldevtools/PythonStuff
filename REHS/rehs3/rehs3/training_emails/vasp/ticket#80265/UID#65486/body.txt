Hello.  I recently obtained access to Comet and I installed vasp_sol locally on my account.  I would like to run vasp_sol but I am not sure how to specify the version of vasp that I would like to run within the vasp.sb file.  There are some differences between how this is done on Comet and Stampede2.

How can I specify the version of vasp that I would like to use?
