Dear colleague at help desk,

I tried to get the right environment to compile my VASP code through 

module purge
module load gnutools
module load intel/2016.3.210
module load intelmpi

however, I still couldn't locate the mpiifort.

I realized sometimes it does work, but sometimes it doesn't work.

My working directory is: ywfang@comet-ln2.sdsc.edu  ~/VASP/vasp5.4.4/vasp.5.4.4 

I find that if I try to list the directory of /opt/intel/2016.3.210/, it will show the following errors:
ls: cannot access /opt/intel/2016.3.210/: Too many levels of symbolic links

Could you help figure it out? Thank you very much.
