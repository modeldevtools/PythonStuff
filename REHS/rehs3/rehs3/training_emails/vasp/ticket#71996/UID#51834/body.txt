Dear XSEDE Admin,

I, Kamalika Ghatak, am a new user of the Comet cluster.
My user id is : *kghatak*. I am co-PI of a startup allocated project :
TG-DMR170065

I will be using VASP for most of my projects. I looked through your example
files for jobs submission. As  I am new to this field, I am not being able
to prepare submission script related to VASP. Will it be possible for you
to provide me the GPU and CPU submission scripts for VASP ?

Thanks for all your time and cooperation. I am eagerly waiting for your
response.
