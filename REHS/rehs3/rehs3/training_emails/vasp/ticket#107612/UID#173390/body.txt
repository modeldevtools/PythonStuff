Hi,
I am having problem running the vasp module 5.4.4. When I submit the job using sbatch command, it shows me following error: 

[proxy:0:0@comet-06-19.sdsc.edu] HYDU_create_process (../../utils/launch/launch.c:622): execvp error on file vasp_std (Permission denied)

By the way, I think I am part of my group's vasp license user list. Please let me know how can I solve this issue.

Thanks.
