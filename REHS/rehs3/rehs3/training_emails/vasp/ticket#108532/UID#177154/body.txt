Hi. I'm currently running vasp jobs in COMET cluster. I used the default vasp module in the cluster. However, I found that for my jobs (~200 cpus ), the run-time in Comet is around  three times longer than a similar job in Bridges regular cluster. I'm wondering if you have any suggestions on improving the performance of vasp in COMET cluster? Thanks.
