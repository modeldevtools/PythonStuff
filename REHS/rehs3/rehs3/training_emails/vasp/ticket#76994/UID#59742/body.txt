Dear Comet Staff,

I am Tianli, a user of Comet. I have the license of VASP, and the number is
5-225, license holder: Prof. Sokrates Pantelides. Is it possible to let me
know how I can use VASP in Comet? Or, could you share a Makefile with me so
I that I can compile my own VASP package in my own directory? My user ID is
Tianli. Many thanks.

Best,
Tianli
