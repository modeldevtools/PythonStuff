Hello,

I have a startup allocation on the Comet Cluster. I just added a new
postdoc (Sriram Ramkumar, xsede username srirampr) to my allocation. I
would like him to be able to use VASP on Comet. Can you please confirm him
as a VASP user? The information for my VASP license is:

[1]  The VASP license number: 5-2919
[2] The name of the PI on the VASP license: Elizabeth Nowadnick (me)

Thanks,
Beth
