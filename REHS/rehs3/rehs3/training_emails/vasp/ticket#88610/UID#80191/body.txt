Dear Sir,

      I have access to VASP on Comet, but I keep getting error message as I tried to submit a job to Comet. I guess that it must be some minor mistake. Below I am pasting my script and would you please tell me where I did wrong? Thanks

#Generate a hostfile from the slurm node list
export SLURM_NODEFILE=`generate_pbs_nodefile`

#load VASP module
module load vasp/5.4.4

#Run the job using mpirun_rsh
mpirun_rsh -hostfile $SLURM_NODEFILE -np 48 vasp_std
