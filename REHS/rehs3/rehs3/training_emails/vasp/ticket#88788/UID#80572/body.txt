Dear colleagues,

I found all my VASP jobs submitted in the past 6 hours crashed, my job script and vasp executable file should be very robust because I have used them for a couple of months. About one or two days ago, I used VASP and didn't find anything abnormal.

The log file and the script for submitting jobs are attached. I'll appreciate it if you can help find something that may cause the errors. Thank you very much.

Bests
