Hi guys


I was wondering if you can kindly provide me a makefile for VASP-5.4.4 for Comet, apparently the executable available in the machine does not have BEEF-vdW functional implemented. Also, 5.4.4 uses mpiifort and I can see it's available in intel/2016.3.210, but when I load the module, still I'm not able to use mpiifort. Can you please look into it?


Thanks!

Saleheen
