Dear Team,

I am trying to run vasp following the example script in this directory:
*sftp://adarwish@comet.sdsc.xsede.org/share/apps/examples/VASP
<http://adarwish@comet.sdsc.xsede.org/share/apps/examples/VASP>*

But I get an error with 'which' command; no vasp found.

I am attaching the script that I used.

Please, can you provide me with updated jobscripts for vasp and quantum
espresso to run them on comet, stampede2, and bridges?

BTW, please find the following information regarding the vasp license(HPC
Bridges admin has confirmed this license):
PI: Dr. Jacob Eapen (jeapen@ncsu.edu)
License Number: 5-932

Thank You.
