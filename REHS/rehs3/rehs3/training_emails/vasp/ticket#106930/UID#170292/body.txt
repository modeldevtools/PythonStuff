Hello, 

When reviewing the VASP compiles available on Comet, I see they have the standard, gamma point, GPU, and noncollinear versions are available. I was interested in creating several different compiles of VASP to run on Comet. The first, utilizing the VASPsol plugin, the second utilizing VASP Transition State Theory (VTST) to perform Nudged Elastic Band (NEB) calculations, and a third incorporating Wannier90. 

If possible, could you please provide me with the makefile and associated files so that I may compile a version which utilizes these plugins. It would be beneficial for both me and Comet to use a version optimized by the Comet team themselves as it would reduce the amount of SU I'd use per job. I can provide you with the user license from my university if necessary, although it may already be on file from my time using VASP at TACC. If it is the case that you are not permitted to share those files, would it be possible for you, the Comet Team, to compile versions of VASP which utilize these plugins. 

Thank you for your time and I look forward to hearing back from you.
