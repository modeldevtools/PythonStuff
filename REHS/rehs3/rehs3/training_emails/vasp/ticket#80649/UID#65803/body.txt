Hi,
 I tried submitting a job to comet for the first time using  the job submission file listed below  and  received a prompt that I am an invalid user as indicated in the attached snapshot. . The vasp.sb  file I used in submitting the job contained the following: 

#!/bin/bash
#SBATCH --nodes=2
#SBATCH --tasks-per-node=24
#SBATCH -t 30:15:00
#SBATCH -o vasp.out
#SBATCH -e vasp.err
#SBATCH -p compute
#SBATCH --export=ALL

module unload intel
module load vasp
exe=`which vasp_std`
processors=$(( $SLURM_NNODES * $SLURM_NTASKS_PER_NODE ))
mpirun  -np $processors -genv I_MPI_FABRICS shm:ofa $exe >& vasp.log


my allocation  code is TG-ENG170002.

Could you assist me to rectify this in this respect.
