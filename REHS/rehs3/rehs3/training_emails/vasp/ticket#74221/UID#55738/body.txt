Dear experts:

When using "module load vasp" on Comet, the default version loaded on is VASP 5.4.4. The output is a little bit different than before older version. I want to use VASP 5.3.5 instead, since the output suits some scripts written for VASP. Then how could I load on this specific version of VASP?

Thanks very much !
