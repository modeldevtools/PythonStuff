Hello Admin,

I am a user of VASP on SDSC Comet. However, I found out that the version of VASP compiled on Comet is without the Wannier90 library, which is required for calculation of the electronic band structure for materials.

Would it be possible for the software team to compile VASP with the Wannier90 library?

Thank you

With best regards,
