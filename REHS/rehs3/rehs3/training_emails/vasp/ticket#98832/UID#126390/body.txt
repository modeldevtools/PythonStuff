Dear all,
Recently, my group acquired license for VASP (Group License number: 5-3179). I am wondering if the following members of my group can be given access:

Pratibha Dev
Priyanka Manchanda
Ivan Naumov
Olasunbo Farinre
Tamanna Joshi

Please let me know if you need additional information from me.

Best,

Pratibha
