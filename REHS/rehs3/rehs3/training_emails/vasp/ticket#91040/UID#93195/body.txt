Hello,

Our group was awarded a startup allocation at Comet. On the XSEDE website, I can check that the project is active. But when I try to access it with gsissh comet (on the XSEDE Sign In Hub), I get a "permission denied" message. How can I get access to comet?
Thank you for your support.

Michel
