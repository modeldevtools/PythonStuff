Hello, I am a member of Alexey Kolmogorov's research group at Binghamton University, and have authorization to use the VASP software using the group license. However, my attempts to submit VASP jobs via the SLURM submission system fail and I believe it's because I don't have VASP permission on Comet.

When I run the command "id" it gives me this output:

uid=521742(athorn) gid=10406(sbi114) groups=10406(sbi114)

Can I be granted VASP permissions on Comet?
