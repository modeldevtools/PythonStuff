Dear Sir/Madam, 

I am  a new user to Comet who would run some VASP simulations. I have the authority of VASP on stampede2. 

I can successfully load the "VASP/5.4.4" module on Comet but cannot find the executable file (I guess it would be vasp_std?)  I was wondering if you could help me on this? Thank you very much!

FYI, my xsede account is yoh5120.

Best,

Yong-Jie
