To whom it may concern,
      I have encountered a weird problem of VASP on Comet.
      A typical DFT (VASP) calculation involves two steps: one is atomic 
relaxation and the other is a final self-consistent calculation. The two 
calculations have the same size (in terms of memory usage). However, 
what I have found is that I successfully finished the first step (atomic 
relaxation). But the final self-consistent calculation crashes. The 
error is "SIGSEGV, segmentation fault occurred". VASP forum says that it 
is likely due to memory and/or compilation. But I use exactly the same 
executable to finish the relaxation calculation.
      The running directory is: 
/oasis/scratch/comet/hchen/temp_project/pressure-ferro/Pb2CoOsO6/P21n-80atom/Yuewen/P-0GPa/SOC
      The job id is: 18868927, 18852228, 18852153
      The job script is shown below.
      Thank you very much for your help.
