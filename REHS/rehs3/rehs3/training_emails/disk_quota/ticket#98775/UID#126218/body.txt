Hi,

I am trying to run Qchem jobs in comet. I am running EOM-CCSD calculation in a system which uses 260 basis functions. So, the CC_MEMORY required is somewhere around 35000 MB. I set it up as 40000 MB and make the MEM_TOTAL about 50000 MB which should overwrite the default 4000 MB. I am running them in the shared partition which, as far as I know, has more than 100 GBs of RAM for local scratch SSD. which is where I am running them. However, it fails at the step where it has to allocate 40000 MB. 

The following is the last line of output file:
 Allocating and initializing 40000MB of RAM...

The following are the last few lines of the slurmjob output:
exported envs:   QC QCAUX QCSCRATCH QCRUNNAME QCFILEPREF QCPROG QCPROG_S GUIFILE
/opt/qchem/bin/mpi/mpirun_qchem.ch_p4: line 243:  2144 Killed                  /opt/qchem/exe/qcprog.exe "indole2.inp_2079.0" "./indole2/" -p4pg /scratch/pratip/20008266/PI2089 -p4wd /scratch/pratip/20008266
cp: cannot stat `/scratch/pratip/20008266/indole': No such file or directory
slurmstepd: Exceeded step memory limit at some point.

Any help will be appreciated.

Thank you.
