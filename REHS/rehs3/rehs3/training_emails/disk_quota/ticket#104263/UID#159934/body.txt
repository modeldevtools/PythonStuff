Hi,

My job was terminated with some MPI messages that seem to be memory issues. The job ID is 21629725. It is located at
/oasis/scratch/comet/xhwu/temp_project/LAF/L37.5n768/output1_v4.0_9.0_1.0
and the output and error files are std.21629725.*

It is a bit strange because by the time the simulation stopped, the largest allocation for each core is less than 3000 MB (according to memory.txt), while I set the max memory size limit to be 3500 MB. Could you tell me what those error messages possibly imply? Did the simulation just suddenly require more than 500 MB per core of extra memory?
