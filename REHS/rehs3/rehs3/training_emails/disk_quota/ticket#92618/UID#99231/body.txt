Dear Comet team,

I am getting 
"[mpiexec@comet-19-51.sdsc.edu] HYDU_sock_write (../../utils/sock/sock.c:417): write error (Input/output error)
[mpiexec@comet-19-51.sdsc.edu] stdoe_cb (../../ui/utils/uiu.c:399): unable to write data to stdout/stderr"

Is it space issue? 

directory: /oasis/scratch/comet/okf/temp_project/LFO_LSMO/QE/6x6/AFM_FM/bck

Regards,
Summayya
