Hi, 

my username for comet is “jseo”. Recently I tried a file transfer and I found that my disk allocation is around 100GB. 
When I exceeded 96GB of disk usage, I got an error message like “Disk quota exceeded”. 
One question: do I share my disk space with other lab members?
Second question: can I increase my disk space? 100GB is too small. 

Thanks, 

Jongmin
