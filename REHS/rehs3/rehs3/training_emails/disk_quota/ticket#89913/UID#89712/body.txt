[Ticket created from XUP by lpalmi]

[System: Oasis]
[Category: Allocations]
I have a new account. When I try to copy a file from my home directory ("home/lpalmi") to my project's working directory in oasis ("/oasis/projects/nsf/sds154/lpalmi") I receive the error "cp: Disk quota exceeded". My online portal shows that I have 500GB of memory allocation available, the file is less than 1GB.

Thanks in advance for your help,

Elizabeth
