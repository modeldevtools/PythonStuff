I noticed that my home directory has a very low disk capacity limit, roughly 100GB. When I do df -h ., it says:

comet-nfs-32-1:/export/nfs-32-1/home/qiyunzhu
                      2.5T   90G  2.5T   4% /home/qiyunzhu

Seems that there is lots of space left. However, I cannot write into them any more. This problem has been with me since I started using Comet. Can you help with this? Thanks!
