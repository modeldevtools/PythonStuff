I am not able to check my quota

$ quota
quota: error while getting quota from 132.249.108.62:/sebat-lab for erfan (id 523050): Connection refused

I mainly want to see how much SU's we have left for the project ddp340 and how much disk quota we have left on
/oasis/projects/nsf/ddp340

My PI: tyson1@comet.sdsc.edu

Thanks,
Erfan
