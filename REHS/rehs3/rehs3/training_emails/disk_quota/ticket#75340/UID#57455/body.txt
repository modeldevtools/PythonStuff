Hi, 

I am trying to transfer ~80GB of files into a shared project directory (/oasis/projects/nsf/cob132/tyst3273), but each time I attempt the file transfer, I get an error message. 

I am attempting to copy an entire directory. The terminal displays the status as it copies and, after a few small files (~4MB) transfer successfully, it attempts to copy a slightly larger file (~1.5GB) and then terminates, displaying 'disk quota exceeded.' It then moves on to the next file and the same error appears and so on until it has failed to copy all files in my directory. 

I have attempted the file transfer using both 'scp' in the terminal and using Globus, but both methods fail with the same message (disk quota exceeded). 

Some guidance or information would be much appreciated!

Thank you.
