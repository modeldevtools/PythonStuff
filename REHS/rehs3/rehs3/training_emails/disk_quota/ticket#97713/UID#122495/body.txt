My jobs keep getting dumped.  I believe the reason is that my disk quota is somehow being exceeded even though I have been eliminating the large checkpoint files as well as the Gauss-xxx files as the jobs are completed.  Is there something wrong with my account or some other way that I can do my jobs?  I haven't loaded more than 30 at a time and some really don't require all that much disk space.
