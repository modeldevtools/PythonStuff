Hi there, 

I am copying some files and folders under our project directory, but I get error like:

Disk quota exceeded

I find our allocation info by
lfs quota -g cit176 /oasis/projects/nsf

And it returns
Disk quotas for grp cit176 (gid 10722):
     Filesystem  kbytes   quota   limit   grace   files   quota   limit   grace
/oasis/projects/nsf
                8694493943       0 20480000000       -  254921       0       0       -

It seems that we still have space for dataset. So may I ask if there is a way to fix the issue?

Thanks,
Zhongxu
