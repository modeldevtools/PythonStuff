Hello,

I have installed wien2k software successfully. It is working fine in serial but does not work in parallel.  

The error is :/oasis/scratch/comet/smandal/temp_project/test_FeO/w2k/FeO/FeO.dayfile
and /oasis/scratch/comet/smandal/temp_project/test_FeO/w2k/FeO/log_lapw

the source code is /home/smandal/W2k/w2k_14
I have used 
module unload mvapich2_ib
module unload intel
module load intel/2016.3.210
module load intelmpi/2016.3.210 

to install the code. 
There is a file called parallel_options that sets the parallel configuration for the wie2k. It is possible I am not giving correct values for it.  

I am with the start-up grant where I am installing codes and getting scaling results. I would really appreciate your quick help.  

Thanks!
