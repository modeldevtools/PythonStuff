Hi, 
 Most of my jobs submitted on Comet fails due to the following error:
In  /oasis/scratch/comet/$USER/temp_project I do not have much data and in fact size of my data are not that large. But I do not understand why I get this error. How much space each user has in scratch directory?

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/home/mkhoshle/miniconda2/envs/py3/lib/python3.6/shutil.py", line 122, in copyfile
    copyfileobj(fsrc, fdst)
  File "/home/mkhoshle/miniconda2/envs/py3/lib/python3.6/shutil.py", line 82, in copyfileobj
    fdst.write(buf)
OSError: [Errno 28] No space left on device
