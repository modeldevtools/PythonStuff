I'm trying to understand what the recommended workflow is with respect to where to run jobs and where to store files long-term. I saw that we're not supposed to run jobs in our home directories, and that we have to keep storage there below 100 GB. I also saw that I can store files in my oasis temp_project folder, which is now where I'm running my jobs and writing simulation output to. But I can't find any information on what the storage limits are there, and how often if ever that directory gets purged. I expect to accumulate a few hundred GB for the project I'm running on Comet right now, and ideally I'd like to be able to analyze my data on Comet instead of having to move it every time. Can you help me understand what the best way to do that is? Will my files be safe in temp_project, or will I have to move them somewhere else immediately after each set of simulations?

Thanks in advance,
-Ben
