Hi I am running QM/MM calculations in GAMESS on Comet and my .dat file and .trj file that I am getting back are as large as 10.34GB or more. Currently I am running them on my directory in comet : /home/sturzo/successful_testrun
Since I am getting such large trajectory files(.trj) and .dat file should I move to : 

/oasis/scratch/comet/sturzo/temp_project/r 

and run my calculations from there?

Please let me know Bargeen.
