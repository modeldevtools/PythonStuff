Dear all,

I am contacting you because I want to ask you about the possibility of increasing my disk quota to (temporarily) store the output files from GPAW calculations. Giving that some of my important output files are ~50G, would it be possible to increase the storage space. At the moment, I cannot run or edit any file by using my account.
Best regards,

Rosalba
