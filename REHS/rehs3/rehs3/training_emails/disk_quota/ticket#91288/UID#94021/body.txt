Hello, 

my jobs are quitting after 24h (while submitted for 48h) with the message: 

FATAL ERROR: No space left on device. 

I run my jobs in scratch, f.e.:

/oasis/scratch/comet/kravchen/temp_project/abf_july6_2018/3

The size of my current directories there amounts to ~524G. I thought scratch has 10T available, is that correct? What could be the problem? 

Thanks in advance, 

Olga
