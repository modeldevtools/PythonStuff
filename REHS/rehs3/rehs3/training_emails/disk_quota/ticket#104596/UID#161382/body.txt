Hello,

My last job ran into my hard disk quota and failed. This is the first time I learned of my quota, roughly 10 Tb. As I understand it, the quota is per user. It is almost impossible for me to make progress with this much space, so I am inquiring as to whether I could be granted an increase.

Thank you,

John
