Hi,

I have encountered the following error while processing my jobs.

mv: cannot create regular file `/oasis/scratch/comet/svelkur/temp_project/UKB/DAL_UKB/proc/MRIPROC_3516797_20216_2_0_20150224.134449.422000_1/MPR1_uw_wmbc.mgz': Disk quota exceeded

With reference to this, can my Disk quota be increased?

comet user id : svelkur


Thanks,
Sundar
