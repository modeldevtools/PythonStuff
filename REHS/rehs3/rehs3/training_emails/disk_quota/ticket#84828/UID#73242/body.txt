Hi,
Sorry to bother you but I have a problem running jobs on Comet. The issues is related to the storage of the data. I am running openFoam cases on :
/oasis/scratch/comet/bha212/temp_project

folder, however the run keep crashing due to writing data issues. I checked how much storage I am using and I discovered that when I reach 100GB the jobs will not be able to write anymore and kill signal will stop the job.
The error log is shown below:

[19] 
[19] 
[19] --> FOAM FATAL IO ERROR: 
[19] error in IOstream "/oasis/scratch/comet/bha212/temp_project/Bashar_2P_5D_2.8mil/processor19/30.909787807684917738/UMean" for operation Foam::Ostream& Foam::operator<<(Foam::Ostream&, Foam::doubleScalar)

How can I solve this issue ? I need to save data up to 200GB,
Sorry for that.

Regards,
Bashar
