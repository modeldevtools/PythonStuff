Dear XSEDE admin,

I am the co-PI of the newly allocated project.
I am wondering if you can let me know the latest oasis allocation name
under /oasis/projects/nsf/ folder.

Previously, it was nji101; nji103 and nji105.

It would be great if you can let us know so that we can submit jobs from
that folder itself. The memory of the home directory is getting over.

Thanks,
-Kamalika
