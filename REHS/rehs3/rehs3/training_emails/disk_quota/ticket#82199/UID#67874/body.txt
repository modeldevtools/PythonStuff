hello,
I am trying to copy a radiation database in my home directory which will be used in some engine study. The database is pretty large (50 GB) in volume. I moved my database to comet home directory in a tarball archive. But, when I try to untar the file, I am getting an error saying "Disk quota exceeded". How can I solve this issue? I am attaching a screenshot that shows the errors

I am looking forward to your kind assistance in issue.
