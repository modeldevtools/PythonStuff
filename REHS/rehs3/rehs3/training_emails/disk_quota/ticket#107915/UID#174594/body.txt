Good morning,

I have a question concerning job 23217901, which I submitted this morning
on the Comet cluster. This job is supposed to use a set of nested for-loops
to run 288 individual calculations with my local copy of the Quantum
ESPRESSO pw.x program. However, as far as I can tell, the job has silently
failed after the completion of the first calculation--you can see the
output at /oasis/scratch/comet/seltinge/temp_project/TiO2/frozenph_2x2b.
There are some outfiles from a previous run of the job, but the only one
resulting from job 23217901 is "scf_34331.out." The job appears to not have
touched any files in the directory in more than two hours, nor has it
written anything to its error file. Is it possible to diagnose what's going
on here?

If it helps, I have encountered this issue twice already in the past 24
hours, with jobs  23215209 and 23215867, which I have since terminated. The
very similar job 23217897 appears to be running correctly so far in the
directory /oasis/scratch/comet/seltinge/temp_project/TiO2/frozenph_2x2.

Best,
