Hello,

I have been trying to copy files between two different users on Xsede comet: rbarkan and kaushiks.
If I use scp I get the error 
Disk quotas for usr rbarkan (uid 505078):
even for files as small as 120K.

If I try to use globus (following the instructions online) I get:
error: globus_xio: Unable to connect to comet.sdsc.xsede.org:2811
globus_xio: System error in connect: Connection refused
globus_xio: A system call failed: Connection refused

Can you please advise?
Because we are multiple users on the same project we really need to be able to copy files across.

Thanks a lot,

Roy
