Hi



When I try to make a dir in my account, it gives me



mkdir: cannot create directory `mono_wt_new_tempRange': Disk quota exceeded



My account is wenhua93, and comet.sdsc.xsede.org<http://comet.sdsc.xsede.org>



I don’t think it’s exceeded yet.



Any of you can help me with this?



Thanks
