[System: Comet]

Good morning,

I'm having issues with my jobs on Comet. They run fine for multiple hours and then they crash with the following error message:

 ERROR: Abnormal termination: NetCDF OUTPUT.
 REASON: No space left on device

The full log of the job is at:

/home/pstlaure/ecb_roms/headers_ecb_update20180223/control_1979_2014_airsea_co2.17869781.comet-26-34.out

The executable is at:

/home/pstlaure/ecb_roms/headers_ecb_update20180223/oceanM

It is a Fortran 95 job using MPI. It was compiled with the default libraries/compiler of Comet:

1) intel/2013_sp1.2.144   2) mvapich2_ib/2.1        3) gnutools/2.69          4) hdf5/1.8.14            5) netcdf/4.3.2

The outputs of the job were being written to:

/oasis/scratch/comet/pstlaure/temp_project/out_ecb/run108/

and our disk usage on this scratch filesystem is very modest:

du -sh --apparent-size /oasis/scratch/comet/pstlaure/temp_project/
70G     /oasis/scratch/comet/pstlaure/temp_project/

I'm confused by the "No space left on device" message considering that we are only using 70G.
Any advice/help would be highly appreciated.

Thanks for your time,
Pierre
