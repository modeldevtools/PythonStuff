Hello,
I recently ran a batch job that ended with the line “slurmstepd: Exceeded step memory limit at some point.” I ran this on the large-shared partition in the file /oasis/scratch/comet/hamln19/temp_project/VELVET which is an extra directory with more space I believe. Why is this job running out of memory, and how can I fix this?
Thank you,
Lauren Hamm
