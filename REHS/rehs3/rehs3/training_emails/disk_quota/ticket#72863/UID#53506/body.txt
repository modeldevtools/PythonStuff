My job on comet quited due to 
"wrf.exe: posixio.c:237: px_pgout: Assertion `*posp == ((off_t)(-1)) || *posp == lseek(nciop->fd, 0, 1)' failed.
forrtl: error (76): Abort trap signal

I believe it is because I used up my space. 
Can I transfer my previous outputs to Data Oasis solve the issue? 

I am doing the following operation right now. But it seems very slow.  Am I doing right? 
xhu2@comet-ln3.sdsc.edu:/oasis/scratch/comet/xhu2/temp_project/Run/RegionalClimate/WRFV3.7.1/YSU_ContinousRun$ mv wrfNCEP_DOE2d_UCM_Snudge_WangRec53wave.2003080100 /oasis/projects/nsf/uok114/xhu2/RegionalClimate_WRFV3.7.1_YSU_ContinousRun/.
