Help desk,
Yesterday (10_2) and today I have submitted qsub commands for file
(dibutylcyclopentane.inp). These two
files have been accepted to Q, then rejected by R. The batch file is
"gauss". As far as I know these files follow the same as
previous files that ran.
Please tellme my error (included below) and how to correct it.
Thank you.
