I see that our /oasis/projects/nsf/msu101  Disc quota of 2 Tb has been exceeded.  I confess to being oblivious to this eventuality.  

The current allocation asked for 2 Tb, but I did not realize that referred to the Oasis space.  I was thinking it referred to an alternate long-term space.

I am asking for advice on options to be able to continue computing during this allocation period.  There are 4 of us who will be active for the next 6 months.

I apologize  for letting this situation develop.
