Hi Mahidhar,

Is there a quick way to estimate my current disk usage on /oasis/scratch/comet ? I deleted a bunch of files but am wondering get how much I am using now. du -sh takes a very long time. I wonder if there is another maybe comet-specific command.

Thanks again for the reminder email and for all your help,

Shyam
