Hi,

I am running a simulation on Comet using OpenFOAM. During this simulation, the error outputs:

FOAM FATAL ERROR: 
[65] Couldn't create directory "/oasis/scratch/comet/h7ris/temp_project/ValidationCases/StabilityRotations/11TotalRotations/processor65/1.3"
[65] 
[65]     From function bool Foam::mkDir(const Foam::fileName&, mode_t)
[65]     in file POSIX.C at line 434.
[65] 
FOAM parallel run exiting

for all the processors. (I have attached a log file). I am using 4 nodes and all the cores on these nodes. I ran a similar simulation before using the same number of nodes saving data in the same scratch directory. I don't think its OpenFOAMs error.

The only reason I can think of is that somehow, I managed to fill out my allocated disk space in oasis/scratch.

Kindly let me know if there is any suggestion
