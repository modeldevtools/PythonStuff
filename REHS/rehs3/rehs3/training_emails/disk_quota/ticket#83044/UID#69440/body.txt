Good afternoon,


I am a Comet user (username mmotta)

Today I tried copying some files on my Comet account,

and I received the "disk quota exceeded" message


Example: from the folder

/oasis/projects/nsf/cwm103/mmotta/R_1.1/N-200/PARAMAGNETIC

the command

cp -r ../FILES-0 ./

gives the output

cp: writing `./FILES-0/LM_gms': Disk quota exceeded

cp: writing `./FILES-0/one_body_gms': Disk quota exceeded

cp: writing `./FILES-0/afqmc/bp_resta.info': Disk quota exceeded

cp: writing `./FILES-0/afqmc/bp_resta.mat': Disk quota exceeded

cp: writing `./FILES-0/afqmc/one_body_gms': Disk quota exceeded

cp: writing `./FILES-0/afqmc/fort.67': Disk quota exceeded

cp: writing `./FILES-0/afqmc/V2b_AO_cholesky.mat': Disk quota exceeded



Can you please help me understanding why?

Today is the first time I notice this problem,

which persisted even after I cleaned my folder from many old files.

I can't even run quota -u mmotta to assess how many resources

I am using, because such command gives me this output
