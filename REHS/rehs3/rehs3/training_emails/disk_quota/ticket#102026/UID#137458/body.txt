Hello,

I was trying to run a batch of (56) jobs that may require huge disk space for temporary files (maybe up to a terabyte for each job). They were running on Luster scratch filesystem (/oasis/scratch/comet/ruixingw/temp_project) but very quickly I receive the message "Disk quota exceeded" when I do any file operation in that folder and the jobs also terminated. I read the Comet User Guide but did not find any detailed instruction on disk quotas. 
To be clear, those are temporary files and will be deleted when the job ends. The results should just cost a few hundred megabytes for each job.

Do you have any suggestion for this case? which filesystem should I use? perhaps Luster project filesystem /oasis/projects/nsf ?

Thank you.

Ruixing
