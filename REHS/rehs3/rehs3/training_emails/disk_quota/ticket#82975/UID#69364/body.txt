I have been running small jobs for the last day or so and they keep stopping for no apparent reason.  I recently received a Disk quota exceeded error.  There is no error written to the *.err files and the log files do not indicate an error either.  It appears to occur if I try to run more than 2 jobs.  I have attached the input, job, err and log files for one of the jobs as an example.
