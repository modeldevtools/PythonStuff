Earlier today I submitted a large batch of jobs to run on comet. When I returned to check on them I noticed comet would not let me store a new text file because my disk quota was exceeded. I quickly cleaned up some space but I noticed that many of my jobs were no longer in the queue. I checked the end of some of the log files to see if they had been killed due to lack of disk space but they just seem to have stopped mid simulation with no explanation. What happens to jobs that are running when you exceed your disk space quota?
