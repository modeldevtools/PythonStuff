I've run some MD simulations that produced very large files, which then exceeded my disk quota.

I am planning to run cpptraj from Amber module to remove the water molecules of the production mdcrd files, and therefore considerably reduce the file size of these files.


However, because my disk quota is exceeded, I can not do anything there.


I am wondering if you could please help me out with this matter? I have a presentation to give about these results on Wed, and I'd really appreciate if I could count on your support to get some files for analysis.


Thanks,


Wilian
