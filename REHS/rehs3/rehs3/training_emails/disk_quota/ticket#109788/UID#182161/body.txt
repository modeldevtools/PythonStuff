Hi,

I have been waiting for my jobs to run on the compute nodes for about two
hours now. I have an extremely important deadline, so I was really hoping
you could help me with this. My tasks are each requesting one node for 10
minutes, so not computationally expensive at all. Yet I have just been on
queue for a very long time. Is there any way I could:
1. Run these tasks on high priority just for today
2. Estimate how long I will need to be in queue

The second thing is, my project is very data intensive and 500 GB is just
too little for us. I am having to spend a lot of time transferring data
back and forth and managing the disk space, and my programs are often
getting errors of running out of disk space. Can you please increase my
disk allocation to at least 1 TB, 2 TB will be preferred. We will be happy
to purchase some storage space for our group if that's possible.

Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Saumya
