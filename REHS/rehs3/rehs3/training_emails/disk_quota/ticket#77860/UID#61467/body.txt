Greetings!

I hope this message finds you well. I have issue in using my allocation. Yesterday I submitted two jobs (case39 job id#12145856 and case40, id# 12139800) Both jobs started but did not go through because disk space exceeded the quote (see exact error message below). However, I believe I have been charged for full requested job SU (each about 16,426 SU). I believe I should receive full SU reimbursement for both jobs (total 32,852 SU). As you can see I have used all my allocations and this would help me run my last two simulation for a publication. I appreciate your cooperation!

Thanks,
