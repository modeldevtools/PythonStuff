In trying to setup a globus endpoint on comet I am redirected to the page

    https://oa4mp.xsede.org/oauth/authorize

The correct username/password for diagrid fails with the message:

    Authentication failed. Only members of active XSEDE projects can log in.


What qualifies as an active project?
