I can't access Comet even though it has been 5 days sign my allocation started. Here is a message from the last ticket:

HI Connor-
As mentioned by Jim,  the process takes about 1 business day to complete.  Your account and allocation should be set on the system by 5pm(PT) tonight.  
Please let us know if we can provide any additional assistance.
Regards,
Nicole

Specifically, I can't login using PuTTY, it seems (I don't know if there is a difference). What should I do to try to speed up this process, if anything?
