Hi there,

I successfully accessed the Single Sign on Server, and tried to gsissh into comet, where I have an allocation with the username “scrowell”, but I get the message:
“Permission denied (publickey,gssapi-keyex,gssapi-with-mic,password,keyboard-interactive,hostbased)”
 
I’m not sure what this means.  The allocation was approved yesterday, but it seems like my account is not set up.

Can you help me out?

Thanks!
