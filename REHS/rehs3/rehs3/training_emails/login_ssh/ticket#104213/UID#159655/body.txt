Hi, I just got a transfer approved to Comet, so maybe everything hasn't been re-activated, but I can't submit jobs. Just in case, I submitted an add user request for my username "rherrer", but I'm already Co-PI, so that should be unnecessary right? Another issue I have is my username on Comet, "r4herrer" is different from my XSEDE username. I used to see "r4herrer" when I clicked on accounts, but its not there anymore. Is it even possible to log in straight to Comet without the single sign on hub? I don't see anything in the documentation.
