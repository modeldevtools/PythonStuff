Hi,

So we had a supplement time provided for Comet GPU. I see the available time on my XSEDE user portal. But I cannot submit jobs on comet to the GPU partition.Not %100 sure but I think the problem is my TACC username is different than my XSEDE username. Likely that my PI requested me being added with my XSEDE username (ozyo), not with my TACC username is (ozge). 

Is there an easy fix for this?
