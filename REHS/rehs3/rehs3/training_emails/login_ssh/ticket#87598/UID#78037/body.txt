I am unable to sign on to comet via the `gsissh comet` command when logged into the XSEDE Single Sign On portal. It gives the following error:

Permission denied (publickey,gssapi-keyex,gssapi-with-mic,password,keyboard-interactive,hostbased).

I requested the trial account on Monday and received approval yesterday at 8:51 AM Pacific Time.

Thanks for your help!
