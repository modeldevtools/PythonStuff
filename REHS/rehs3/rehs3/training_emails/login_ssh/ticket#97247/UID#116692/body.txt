I have registered for the SHI Webinar and part of the hands-on portion requires those who are participating to log into Comet. (This event will occur tomorrow afternoon.) However, when I try to log into comet via "gsissh comet", I get the following error message.

Permission denied (publickey,gssapi-keyex,gssapi-with-mic,password,keyboard-interactive,hostbased)

Can you point me in the right direction to getting access to comet temporary please?
