[Ticket created from XUP by aangius]
[From: Alessio Angius]
[System: OSG]
[Category: Access/Login Issues]
To whom this may concern,

I am Alessio Angius, a member of the Radical group at Rutgers. I am writing because we are not able to login on OSG (submit-1.osg.xsede.org) from our VM (ip address 144.76.72.175). Due to the fact that we are  able to connect from private laptops, it is likely that we got blacklisted because of some failed attempt to login. 
If this is, firstly, I want just to apologize for the bothering and guarantee that we were not performing any kind of DoS. Secondly, I want to ask if it is possible to remove our VM from the blacklist.

Thank you in advance,

Alessio Angius
