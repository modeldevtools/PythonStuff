A student of mine, Haruhiko Kuramochi (haruhiko) appears to have an account on oasis, but when he tries to ssh to oasis-dm.sdsc.edu, the terminal just report that he doesn't have a subdirectory under his account name in home.  What would you recommend that we do?

Thank you very much for your help,
Keith
