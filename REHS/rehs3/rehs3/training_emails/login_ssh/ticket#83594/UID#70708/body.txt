Hi,

I am able to use globus-url-copy without a problem when I am on a Comet login node. But when I try to use the exact same command while running a job via srun or sbatch, I get the following error:



error: globus_ftp_control: gss_init_sec_context failed

globus_gsi_gssapi: Error with gss credential handle

globus_credential: Valid credentials could not be found in any of the possible locations specified by the credential search order.
