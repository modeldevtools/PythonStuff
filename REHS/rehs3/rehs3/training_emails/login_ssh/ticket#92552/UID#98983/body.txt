Hi, my colleague can log into comet using linux in the below manner.

ssh username@comet.sdsc.xsede.org

I made an account several hours ago and can login into the user portal but when I do the following

ssh ctangtar@comet.sdsc.xsede.org

I am prompted to input my password, which I do but the system does not recognize it and continues to prompt for a password.

I also tried 
ssh -l ctangtar comet.sdsc.xsede.org
with similar results.

Any idea what the problem could be?
Thank you for your time, much appreciated. 
sincerely,
Chanin
