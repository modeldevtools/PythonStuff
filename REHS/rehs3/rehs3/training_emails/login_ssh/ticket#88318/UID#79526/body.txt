To whom it may concern,

Hi, I am a new user of XSEDE. The Get Start Guide said I need a local password to directly access Comet via command line. My local username for "comet.sdsc.xsede.org" is "csxtovt". Would you please provide me the local password for it? Thank you very much for your time.

Best regards,
Shunxiang
