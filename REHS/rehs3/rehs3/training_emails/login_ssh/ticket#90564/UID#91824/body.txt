To whom it may concern,

I was wondering if it was possible to set up a passwordless ssh for my account. I want to use cisTEM but it needs to be run from a gui. I can run the gui from my own computer and submit jobs from the gui to the comet queue, but I need to a passwordless ssh into comet. Is it possible to create a Create Authentication SSH-Kegen Keys?

Best,
Michelle Fry
