Dear XSEDE helpers,

I now have my code working beautifully on Comet, thank you for a fantastic resource. I am used to the /bin/tcsh as my default shell, but using "chsh" to change default shells runs  into authentication problems. Would you change the default shell for ibray to /bin/tcsh please, or let me know how to do it.
