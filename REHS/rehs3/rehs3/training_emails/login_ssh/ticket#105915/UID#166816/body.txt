I just got a startup allocation on Comet, but I am unable to log in.  I can log into login.xsede.org with the username 'wlandry'.  I try to connect to Comet with the command

  gsissh comet

and I get the response

  Permission denied (publickey,gssapi-keyex,gssapi-with-mic,password,keyboard-interactive,hostbased).
