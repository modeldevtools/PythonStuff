Hi Nicole,

I cannot log onto comet, I have been given access to both comet and
bridges. I can log onto bridges successfully. I have tried changing my
password but still cannot connect to comet. I have attached a screenshot of
an attempt to log onto comet and then a successful attempt to log onto
bridges. This is an open ticket:
