hi ,
I used to use bridges.psc.xsede.org and comet.sdsc.xsede.org before to store and analyze my data, now I just forget how to log in those resource and get my data.. I has been about 1.5 years since last time I log in. Now I am trying the single sign on hub using my portal user name and password using "ssh -l XUPusername login.xsede.org", it will tell me:
Permission denied (publickey,gssapi-keyex,gssapi-with-mic,keyboard-interactive).
Could you please help on this issue?
