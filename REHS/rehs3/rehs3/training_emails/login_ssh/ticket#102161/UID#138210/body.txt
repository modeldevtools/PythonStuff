Dear Support Team,

We recently got some trial allocation on Bridges, Stampede2 and Comet. I'm able to login to Bridges and Stampede2 via SSO Hub. But when I try to login to Comet, I got permission denied. 
I remember I registered on Bridges and Stampede2 long time ago.
But I don't remember I did this to Comet.

Should I register on Comet and have an account first?
If so, where should I register?

Thanks in advance.
