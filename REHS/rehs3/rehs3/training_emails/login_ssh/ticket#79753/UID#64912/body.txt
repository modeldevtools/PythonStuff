Hi,

I am facing a problem when I try to transfer a directory from comet to stampede2 via scp.

I am using the following command (Where asif3313 is my username, group_2 is the directory name,  /oasis/projects/nsf/lsu124/asif3313/group\_2 is the sender's path in comet and /home1/05288/asif3313/ is the path where I want to transfer the path of stampede).

 scp /oasis/projects/nsf/lsu124/asif3313/group\_2 asif3313@login4.stampede.tacc.utexas.edu:/home1/05288/asif3313/

The systems prompts for my password for 3 times, after giving the password, it says:

 Permission denied (publickey,keyboard-interactive).

Thank you in advance,
Asif
