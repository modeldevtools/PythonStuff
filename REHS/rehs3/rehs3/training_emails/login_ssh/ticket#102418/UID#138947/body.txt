Hi, 

My name was added yesterday to the project Oceanic Circulation Across Multiple Scales | TG-OCE030000N. But I do not see my username agjagann in the accounts page of my XSEDE portal, nor am I able to ssh to Comet as ssh agjagann@comet.sdsc.xsede.org. I am also unable to login as ssh -l agjagann login.xsede.org. Please let me know if you need any further info from my side.

Thanks,
Arjun
