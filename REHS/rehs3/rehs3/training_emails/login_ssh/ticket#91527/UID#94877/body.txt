Dear XSEDE staff,
I just received my trial allocation on the COMET cluster.  I am trying to ssh to the system to compile my code.  I read that I first need to ssh to login.xsede.org which
I did with
*******
canegarden:~ falk$ ssh -l falk login.xsede.org
Please login to this system using your XSEDE username and password:
password:  (I typed my XUP password many times)
Please login to this system using your XSEDE username and password:
password:
Please login to this system using your XSEDE username and password:
password:
Permission denied (publickey,gssapi-keyex,gssapi-with-mic,keyboard-interactive).
********
My XUP password did not work even though I can use the same username and password to log onto the XSEDE User Portal with same username "falk" and my password

I tried this a few times and eventually I am locked out

canegarden:~ falk$ ssh -l falk login.xsede.org
ssh: connect to host login.xsede.org port 22: Connection refused

Ideas?
Thank you.
Falk Feddersen
