Dear XSEDE Help Desk,

I am currently accessing the Comet cluster via SSH and would like to be
able to forward X11 graphics. I have the X11 forwarding flag enabled and
have an Xserver installed on my local machine; however, I cannot open any
images, e.g. through 'eog'. I have tried this through the Windows Subsystem
for Linux as well as a Ubuntu virtual machine, as well as setting the
DISPLAY environment variable to localhost:0.0. I am able to view images
when accessing other remote locations. I was wondering if you had any
advice in this regard.


Thank you,
Kevin Chau
