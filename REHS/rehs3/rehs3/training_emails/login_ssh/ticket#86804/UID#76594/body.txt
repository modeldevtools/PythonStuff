We have allocations in Comet GPU, but we can't log in to the hostname "comet.gpu.sdsc.xsede.org"
But we can log in to "comet.sdsc.xsede.org", the issue is when we check the account "show_accounts", no information. We can't submit the job through this hostname
Do you know anyway, we can run GPU code on Comet
Thanks
