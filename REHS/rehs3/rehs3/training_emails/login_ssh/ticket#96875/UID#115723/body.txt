Hello,

I want to write myself a few comments on login (similar to the printed out text provided by the admin) however I found out today that using echo, and even cat on a text file conflicts with scp and the files are not copied.
Is there a way to work around this, so that I can have information written for myself on login, and still be able to scp?

Thank you
