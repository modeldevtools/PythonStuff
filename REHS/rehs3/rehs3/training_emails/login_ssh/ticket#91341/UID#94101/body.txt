I'm not able to transfer files from Comet using Globus today. I'm not sure where the error is coming from so I'm checking with with you all as well as Globus. When I try to access Comet via Globus I get 
"Authentication Failed
Your credentials do not provide sufficient access to this endpoint. If you have alternative credentials you may need to deactivate this endpoint and try again."

I'm able to access my other endpoints (Bridges, personal computer, etc.), but just not Comet. I am also able to access Comet as a resource (via ssh).

Thanks in advance
Josh
