I'm trying to connect to Comet with my SSH public keys, but it always 
asks for a password.

I've tried purging my `$HOME/.ssh` directory and using `ssh-copy-id` 
from my machine, but the problem persists.

The key works on other machines I connect to.

Is there anything I can do to make this work?

Best regards,
Richard
