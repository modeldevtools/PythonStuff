Hi,

I have installed and set up DUO from the online portal. But when I ssh
ssh -X ricotti@login.xsede.org
I get the following error:
 ssh -X ricotti@login.xsede.org
ssh: connect to host login.xsede.org port 22: Connection refused

Perhaps I tried too many times to login before installing DUO and got blocked.
Or the problem is that I currently do not have allocations. What I need to do is to access my home and storage directories to get some old files.

Thanks
-Massimo
