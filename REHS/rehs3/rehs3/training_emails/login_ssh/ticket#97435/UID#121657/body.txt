Hi, 

I got an log in issue when I want to transfer files from my comet account to local cluster through globus. When I try to log in, I got this message: "Please authenticate to access this endpoint". And when I try to connect, it always failed. So can you help me with this problem? I'm not sure what should I do at this stage. 

Thanks,
Chuqiao
