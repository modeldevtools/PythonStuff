I created an account and i received an email that my user Porter is active. But i tried logging in to my Linus computer where i can probably submit jobs but i am having troubles. I went to my directory and logged in as edward11@comet.sdsc.xsede.org, but it didn't open. I thought maybe that was the password so i requested for a new password but is still not working. But my research advisor who is the primary account is able to login using the same process. Any help. Thank you.
