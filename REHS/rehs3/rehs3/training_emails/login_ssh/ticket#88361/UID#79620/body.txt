To whom it may concern,

I am new to COMET and I observed a wield issue when I log into the system. I am now working with my advisor and need to copy some softwares from his home directory. The issue is that I cannot found his home directory if I were on login node "comet-ln3". However, if I was assigned to login node "comet-ln2", I can find his home directory. So I am wonderring whether different login node has different file systems. But from the sdsc websit: 

"When you log in to comet.sdsc.edu, you will be assigned one of the four login nodes comet-ln[1-4].sdsc.edu. These nodes are identical in both architecture and software environment."

I think all four login nodes should be the same. Can I ask whether this issue is just related to the bad performance? Or do I need to specify the login node when I login? Thank you very much for your time.

Best regards,
Shunxiang
