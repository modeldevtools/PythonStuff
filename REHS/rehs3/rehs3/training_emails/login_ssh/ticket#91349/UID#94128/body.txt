Hi,

I tried to transfer files between Comet and my laptop using Globus but failed to connect to the Comet end point (Name of the end point: Xsede Comet). The error message shown on the globus website is:

Authentication Failed
Your credentials do not provide sufficient access to this endpoint. If you have alternative credentials you may need to deactivate this endpoint and try again.

I was able to use this endpoint to transfer data couple weeks ago but now I cannot. Could you please figure out where is the problem? Are there alternative ways to transfer files to / from Comet?

Best,
Chaoran
