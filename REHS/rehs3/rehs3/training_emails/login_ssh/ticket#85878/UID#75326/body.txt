Hi,
I have an XSEDE account.
My Portal Username is *dmondal*. I have allocation in *"comet"*. My PI
is *Arieh
Warshel*.
When I am trying to login from my terminal using
*ssh dmondal@comet.sdsc.edu <dmondal@comet.sdsc.edu>*
It is asking for my Password. I am giving the Portal account password, and
it is showing
"*Authentication failed.*"
Am I doing something wrong?

Thank you,
