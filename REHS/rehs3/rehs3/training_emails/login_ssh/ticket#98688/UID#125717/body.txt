Dear XSEDE Tech Support,

I am wondering is there a way to login my XSEDE accounts from China, like comet.
Will I login like it in the US using tokens, or is there a VPN way to do it?
I am will be in China for a month or so, I still hope to be able to monitor and manipulate my jobs.

Thank you.
Chenyi
