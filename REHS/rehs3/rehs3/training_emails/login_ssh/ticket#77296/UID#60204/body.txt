Hello,

I have been trying to log into my account via PuTTY and the host name : comet.sdsc.xsede.org for a course at UCSD, but it keeps saying that my access is denied after inputting my password. According to my TA and Professor, I have been added to list of student to be granted access, but the issues has yet to be resolved. 

Thank you,
Priscilla Castanon
