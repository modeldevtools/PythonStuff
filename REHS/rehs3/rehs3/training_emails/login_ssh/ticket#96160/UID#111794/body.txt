Hello,

I'm trying to copy a public key I created for auto-login when I ssh onto
comet.

I'm getting a "can't write ~/.ssh/authorized_keys" error when I run the
command...

vim ~/.ssh/authorized_keys

...and try to copy my public key here. Is there a different way to do this?
This is how I surmised to do this based on the comet getting started page
<https://portal.xsede.org/sdsc-comet>.

Thanks,
Joe
