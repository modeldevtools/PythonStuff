Hi there, 
   The globus web portal to xsede stopped working for me within the past hour.  If I try to access Comet it reports back
 "Authentication failed.   Your credentials do not provide sufficient access to this endpoint."

It was working an hour ago.  I tried deactivating and reactivating my credentials.  It seems to accept the credentials but not access to the system.

I can still ssh into comet without problems.
