Hi,

I am trying to login to comet from ssohub and I got permission deny. As shown below.

    [qinacme@ssohub ~]$ gsissh comet
    Permission denied (publickey,gssapi-keyex,gssapi-with-mic,password,keyboard-interactive,hostbased).

The full logs are shown in attachment `ssh_log.txt` file. Basically, it's complaining the missing of the following files:

debug1: identity file /home/qinacme/.ssh/id_rsa-cert type -1
debug1: key_load_public: No such file or directory
debug1: identity file /home/qinacme/.ssh/id_dsa type -1
debug1: key_load_public: No such file or directory
debug1: identity file /home/qinacme/.ssh/id_dsa-cert type -1
debug1: key_load_public: No such file or directory
debug1: identity file /home/qinacme/.ssh/id_ecdsa type -1
debug1: key_load_public: No such file or directory
debug1: identity file /home/qinacme/.ssh/id_ecdsa-cert type -1
debug1: key_load_public: No such file or directory
debug1: identity file /home/qinacme/.ssh/id_ed25519 type -1
debug1: key_load_public: No such file or directory
debug1: identity file /home/qinacme/.ssh/id_ed25519-cert type -1

So would you please help me to look into it? You can just reset my account to default if necessary. Thank you so much!!!
