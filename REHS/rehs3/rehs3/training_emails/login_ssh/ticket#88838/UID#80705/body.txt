Dear XSEDE help desk,

Hi. 

I received a clean up request that says the files in project space (/oasis/projects/nsf/gsu106) have a size of ~1.29TB, which exceeds my allocated 500 GB.

I would like to transfer the files to a computer in lab.

But I cannot login through ssh or transfer by globus because they both require an active allocation.

What should I do to transfer the files?

Thank you.
