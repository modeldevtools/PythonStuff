Hi,

I was wondering if you might be able to help me figure out how to make a
remote connection to Rstudio through the cluster. I found these instructions
<https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download-server/>, which seemed
promising, but the sudo command won't work (it asks me for a password for
sudo@SDSC.EDU) and I'm not sure if this is the best course of action
anyway. I tried a few other things like setting up a tunnel and using the
"ssh" package in my local Rstudio. The latter seems to be making a
connection, but I'm not sure whether it's actually computing things on the
cluster (and don't know how to check - squeue just shows the interactive
session and history doesn't show me R commands).

I would appreciate any help in getting this figured out.

Thank you,
Maitreyi
