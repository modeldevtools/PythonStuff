When I login xsede website, it is shown I am in Dr. Xiaoming Hu's project. 
But when I login from the XSEDE Single Sign on Login Hub,  I still get 
"[wzp@ssohub ~]$ gsissh comet
Permission denied (publickey,gssapi-keyex,gssapi-with-mic,password,keyboard-interactive,hostbased).
"
Any idea what is going on?   
BTW: what is my account name on Comet? 

Thanks a lot!
