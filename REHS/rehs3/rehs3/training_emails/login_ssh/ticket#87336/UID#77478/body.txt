Hello, 

I am able to sign into my comet account using the 

ssh username@login.xsede.com 

command followed by 

gsissh comet

This method is able to get me into comet with my terminal, but I cannot log in using my file STFP program. I cannot transfer files into my comet account without this program. Attempting to sign in directly into 

ssh username@comet.sdsc.xsede.org 

is not working. 

Thank you, 
Valentin Munoz
