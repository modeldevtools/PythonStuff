Dear xsede help desk, 

I am a new xsede user (registered yesterday) from the university of oklahoma. It seems I cannot login to the SSO Hub (please see attached file). However, I can use the same login username and password to login to the web xsede user portal. Could you please help me to solve this issue? 

Dr. Xiao-ming Hu just added me into his research project. I cc'd him in this email.

Any information would be highly appreciated.

In peace,
Changjie
