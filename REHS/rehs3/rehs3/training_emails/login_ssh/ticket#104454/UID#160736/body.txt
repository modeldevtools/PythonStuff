Hello,

It appears that the Globus endpoint on XSEDE Comet is not responding. I see this error: 

Command Failed: Error (login) Endpoint: XSEDE Comet (de463f97-6d04-11e5-ba46-22000b92c6ec) Server: oasis-dm.sdsc.xsede.org:2811 Message: Login Failed --- Details: 530-Login incorrect. : globus_gss_assist: Gridmap lookup failure: Could not map /DC=org/DC=incommon/C=US/postalCode=92093/ST=CA/L=La Jolla/street=9500 Gilman Drive/O=University of California, San Diego/OU=San Diego Supercomputer Center/CN=cosmic2.sdsc.edu\r\n530-\r\n530 End.\r\n
