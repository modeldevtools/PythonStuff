Dear Sir or Madam,

I am trying to transfer my data to comet.
I am using this command in my system:

scp 1-t007a-B-NCOR.nc zahra83@comet.sdsc.edu:t007-B-NCOR/a

I gives me that "ssh: Could not resolve hostname comet.sdsc.edu: Name or service not known  ".

I tried the other way to scp from my system but it gave me the same error.
Could you please help me with this issue.

Thanks.

Zahra
