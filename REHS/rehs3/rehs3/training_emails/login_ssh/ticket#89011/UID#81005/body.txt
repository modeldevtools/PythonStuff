Hello,

This morning I was added to resources on Comet and Bridges, but when I
tried to submit my first job to Comet, it was rejected because it would not
accept my password. I tried submitting it to Bridges instead, and I tried
submitting it through Terminal instead of Fetch, but it still failed. I
tried logging in to the user portal with the same password, and that did
work. What should I do?
