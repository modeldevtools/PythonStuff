[Ticket created from XUP by lchuang3]
[From: Yuling Chuang]
[System: Comet GPU]
[Category: Access/Login Issues]
My account is a new account, which is created today. I can log in bridges.psc.xsede.org with ssh.

I saw my Username of Comet/Comet-GPU is     lchuang3     I try to log in with my portal password, like:

ssh lchuang3@comet.sdsc.xsede.org 

It asks me to type in my password again and again. But, I can not log in. 

Then I changed my portal password about 1 hour ago. But I still can not log in comet with my new password. I have also tried it with my other personal computers. 

What should I do to log in comet with ssh now?  Thanks.
