Hello,

Currently, I have a 168-hours job running on the Comet (12475619), which most likely will not converge within the given wall time limits. Unfortunately, this is the type of job (i.e., analytic frequency calculations in Gaussian) that does not support the restart. 

I am wondering if the time limits for this job can by further extended as otherwise the already spent resources will be lost? I am expecting that the job should be done within next 72 hours.

I completely understand that such a request is inappropriate but I will greatly appreciate if you could extend the wall time limits for this job. I will make sure that this situation will not happen again.

Thanks,
Maxim
