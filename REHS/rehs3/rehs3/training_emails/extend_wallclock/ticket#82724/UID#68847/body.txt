Hello

Last night I submitted two jobs with the same job script I have been using for weeks and both jobs upon starting wrote out "Open MPI does not support recursive calls of mpiexec", one for every core, and then subsequently sat there burning time and doing nothing. In particular this was jobs 14017212 and 14017271. This may be a ridiculous request but is there any way I can get that time back (these were fairly high core count jobs that sat for ~13 hrs)? More importantly can you help me figure out how to ensure this doesnt happen again.

thanks
drummond
