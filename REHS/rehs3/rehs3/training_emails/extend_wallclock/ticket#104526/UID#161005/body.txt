I was previously doing yearly CO2 downscaling simulations for a single domain within 2day WALLTIME.

Now, to improve the downscaling simulation, I added a nested domain.   Now my yearly CO2 downscaling simulation can not finish in 2day walltime. 
See my job submission script: /oasis/scratch/comet/xhu2/temp_project/Run/CO2_and_otherGHG/WRFV3.9.1.1/China/wrfchem3.9.1.1_R2_China2NE_10mb_Hil3ReShrubRES_addOce_restoreDF_ODIAC_CT2017.2016010100/wrf_0100.sh

In about 1day simulation, the simulation only run for 2.5 months. 

I wonder if you could increase MAX WALLTIME to 5 days for my yearly nested-domain CO2 downscaling? I only need to do 2-3 such downscaling simulations.
With these yearly  nested-domain CO2 simulations, I should be able to write a good paper. 
Thanks a lot!
