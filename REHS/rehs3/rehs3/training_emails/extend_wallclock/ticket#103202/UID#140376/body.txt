Hello,

I was going through the Comet SDSC User Guidelines (https://www.sdsc.edu/support/user_guides/comet.html). It states that there maximum number of nodes one can request is 72 i.e 72 * 24 = 1728 processors and the maximum run time is 48 hours. I had a couple of questions in this regard:

1. I have to run a simulation that would need 4096 MPI Processes. Is there a way of running more than 1 MPI process per processor? If so, can you let me know what exactly should I specify in the submission script?

2. Another simulation I am planning to run would take around 1 week. My current plan is to run it in stages where I run small chunks of the simulation in the maximum allowed 2 day span (48 hours). I also read in the User guidelines that "Comet supports long-running jobs - up to as much as one week by special request.". Can you let me know of the cases where such a request would be accepted and the time taken to process such a request?

Thanks in advance for your support!

Cheers,
Josin
