Dear Sir/Madam,



I am a Ph.D. student at Duke and my Id at XSEDE is "reza1789".



I have a few jobs running on comet with the following information. I specified the duration of these jobs to 160 hours but I am worried that some of them may take more that that. I would appreciate if you could extend these jobs to run for another 24 hours, in case they do not get completed before 160 hours.

Thank you for your consideration.

Best,

Reza
