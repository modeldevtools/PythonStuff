Hi my name is Christina McCulley and I am a graduate student currently running some dynamic calculations. The current run of calculations are long and due to the 48 hour time restrictions are not succeeding in reaching the end of trajectories. I am emailing to ask if for these specific calculations I could have permission to wave the 48 hour time limit.
