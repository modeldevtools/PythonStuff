Hi Mahidhar,

I hope you are doing well. I just have two quick questions:

1) When I submit a job using 8 or 16 nodes, can I ask for more than 24 
hours of job running? I'm asking this because some of my jobs need two 
or three days to complete.

2) It seems there is a problem with file exchange on COMET. I am simply 
trying to move an empty case folder from my scratch to COMET's scratch 
as usual to start a simulation. But, it seems to be frozen, since the 
command:

mv Case_1.1_500_20_08_XFineCyclic /oasis/scratch/comet/mnabil/temp_project

is taking much longer time than expected.

Regards,

Mahdi
