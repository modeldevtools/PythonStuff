Dear comet,

Happy new year!

I was looking at the queue (to estimate how long I should wait for my runs on the queue to start) and noticed that some others' jobs have been running more than the maximum walltime (48 hours). Is it possible that one asks more than 48 hours, or are there some exceptions? My production calculations run for more than 48 hours and I was wondering.

Thank you,
Jaehan Bae
