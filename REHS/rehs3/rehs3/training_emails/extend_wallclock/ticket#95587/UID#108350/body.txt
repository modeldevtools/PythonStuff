Hi,
Is there any way to run a job for more than 48 hours (when it is not possible to restart or pause that long job)? 

Also, I was wondering if there is any queue (may be experimental) which has more than 1.45TB RAM in comet? 

Is it possible to request or book beforehand to run such large-hour or large-memory jobs?

Thanks in advance.

Best,
Bishwajit
