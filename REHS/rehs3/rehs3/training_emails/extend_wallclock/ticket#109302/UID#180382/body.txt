Hello,

A job on SDSC Comet (23874126) that I didn't expect to work seems to be
working, but reports that it will take 4.5 hours instead of the 4 I
guessed. I can think of several reasons you would never grant job time
extensions. If there is any 'one free pass' policy, would you please extend
job 23874126 to 04:45 (thus adding 45 minutes)? If not, I'll just cancel
and start over now.

Thank you,
Jes
