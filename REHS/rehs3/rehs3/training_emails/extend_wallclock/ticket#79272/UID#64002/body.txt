Hi

My username is wenhua93 and on comet wenhua93@comet.sdsc.xsede.org<mailto:wenhua93@comet.sdsc.xsede.org>. When I try to submit jobs on compute   queue if I set up my running time more than 48 hours, my jobs got rejected, just wondering that is that 48 hours is the max running time for me? if not, please let me know how to running longer jobs.

Thanks!
