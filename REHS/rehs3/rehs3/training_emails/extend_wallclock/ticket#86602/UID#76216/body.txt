Good morning,

I am running DESeq2 R package on Comet and this task (differential expression analysis) is an unit (can not divide into smaller tasks and not be paralleled) which uses one core only but it takes time (maybe more 48 hours).

Would you please increase the max walltime into 120 hours?

Thank you for your consideration.
Cuong.
