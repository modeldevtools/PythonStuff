Dear XSEDE and SDSC Help Desks,

I am currently running some timing performance tests for a Fortran software code we wrote to compute polarizabilities and C6 dispersion coefficients using Tkatchenko-Scheffler method with self-consistent screening (TS-SCS). I am testing the scaling requirements (time and memory) for large systems to compare to a new method developed in my group for computing polarizabilities and C6 dispersion coefficients. For some of the larger systems (e.g., ice crystal supercells with 4116, 6144, and 8748 atoms), the TS-SCS method is not completing within 48 hours. We would like to complete these tests so that we can compare the new method (computationally fast) to the prior method (computationally slow) for a plot in a journal article manuscript we are preparing for submission next month.

These tests are being run on one processor (shared queue) in serial mode.

Is it possible for me to run some of these tests for longer than 48 hours on shared queue (e.g., up to 336 hours (2 weeks))?

Sincerely,

Tom Manz
