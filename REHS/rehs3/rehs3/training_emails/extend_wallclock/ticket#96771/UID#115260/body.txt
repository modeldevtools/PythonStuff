Hi there,

I am running an analysis that looked like it would take < 48 hrs but looks like it may run into day 3. Looks like it only has 4 hours left.

JOBID = 19513514
username = solvason

Its not a huge job in terms of memory but I think it is just taking a long time. It was parallelized and the other parallel jobs finished except this one. Is it possible to allow this job to run longer than 48 hours?
