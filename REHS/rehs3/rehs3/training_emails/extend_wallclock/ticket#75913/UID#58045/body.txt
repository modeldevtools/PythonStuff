Regards,
I have two jobs running right now (see job ID below) that are getting close to the walltime limit but are not yet completed.
I was wondering if I could have the walltime limit of these 2 jobs extended at least 12 more hours which is the time I estimate it may take to finish?

          11273699   compute AB_RBS24  padilla  R 1-20:01:32      4 comet-20-[18,33,35,58]
          11273704   compute AB_RBS36  padilla  R 1-20:01:32      4 comet-20-[62-63,66-67]

In another note, I was wondering why I am unable to restart an Abaqus job that has been stopped because of walltime limit using the "abaqus recover" command. I can do it in my laptop but I wonder why the same exact command does not work for a job run in Comet. I wonder if the problem could be that the job needs t access the compiled version of the user routine used before the job was stopped or if the job requires to run in the same node as before. Please any help you could provide regarding this I would appreciate it or in its defect allow me to run with a walltime longer than 48 hours for some of my next simulations.

Thank you for your attention
BEsts,
David P.
