Hi there,

Sorry for asking this request again. It follows our earlier ticket #106373. We are still working on the project and we find that some of our single-core jobs need further test. The total number of this kind of job is around 30 (each jobs just needs one cpu). So can I ask for a reservation of one node (24 cores) with extended wall time? Based on our earlier tests, these jobs should finish within 4-5 days. The total 30 jobs can finish with 2 rounds. I hope this won't affect the system too much. Thank you very much!

Best,
Zhongxu
