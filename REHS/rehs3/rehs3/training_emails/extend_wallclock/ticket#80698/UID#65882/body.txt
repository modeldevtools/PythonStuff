Hi,

I have some high-level quantum chemistry jobs (CASSCF and CASPT2 with large active spaces) which need around 10 days to run. They are not CPU-intensive, but just slow and not capable of being restarted. They are run using the MOLCAS program. Is it possible to have a longer wall time for just these jobs on Comet or Stampede2, even if temporarily? Any help would be really appreciated.

Thanks.

Puja
