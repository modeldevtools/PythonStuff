Hi,

I'm trying to run some DFT calculations to calculate singlet and triplet energies of a molecule. Is there any way I can run the calculations for longer than 48 hours? Some of the molecules are quite large and weren't able to complete in this time limit.

Otherwise is there a way to increase the computational power such that these calculations finish in time? 

Thanks for your help
