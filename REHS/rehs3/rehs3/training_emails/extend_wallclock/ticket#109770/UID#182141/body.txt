Dear XSEDE member,

Currently, I am running Gaussian frequency calculations for two particular
systems and they are taking more than the usual time. The job IDs are
24062804, 24063070. Most probably they should finish within the job time
limit (48 hrs). However, as I have an upcoming deadline to submit a
revision for a paper, could you please allow these jobs to run for one more
day (in case they don't finish within the allocated 48 hrs time limit)?

Also, I would like to know whether I can request for a longer time queue
(=4 days) for a few more jobs which I will be submitting (most probably
tomorrow or day-after-tomorrow)?

Thanks for your support,
Sincerely,
Sharma.
