Hello,

I would like to run some long [~140 hours wallclock time] running jobs on the compute nodes to gauge performance of an adaptive tabulation technique. The results of these tests are affected by restarts and consequently I would like finish each test in a single run. I intend to use 2 nodes per job/test and estimate that I will have to run 30 such (independent) jobs. The COMET webpage details that long running jobs can be accommodated up to a wall clock limit of 1 week.

Can you please let me know if it will be possible for me to run these jobs (as the required wall clock time per job is larger than default 48 hour limit but lesser than maximum 1 week)? If yes, what procedure should I follow to do the same? 

If needed, the charge number for our allocation is TG-CTS160027. Thank you for your help. 

Regards,

Ashish Newale
