I have a large VASP job on Comet that is taking more than 48 hours for a single convergence step, and running out of time. Since it's timing out before it produces output, I can't tell how close it is to finishing. Is there any chance I could get longer runtime for several runs of this job? 

If it helps, the job is 
	vasp_i2016.job
in

Thanks!
