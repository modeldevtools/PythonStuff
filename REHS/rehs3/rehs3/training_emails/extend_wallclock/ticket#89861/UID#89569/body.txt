Hello,

Hope this finds you well!
I have been running a job now for close to 23 hours and the allocated time is 24 hours. I realize the job will not be done in 24 hours thus I attempted to update the time limit with the scontol update command but it wouldn't work and the reason displayed is access/permission denied.
I am wondering if you could help me update the time limit to 48 hours and also help me on how to have access to update such stuff in the future. The entire command and the job ID is below;

scontrol update jobid=16884685 TimeLimit=48:00:00

the path to the batch script it;
/home/maccarth/I-TASSER5.1/I-TASSER5.1/I-TASSERmod/submit_ittas_cometExperntSerial.sh

Thank you
