Hello

I have been trying to run my abaqus jobs on the supercomputer since last evening but they keep getting queued for very long times. I have a deadline for tonight. Is it possible for me to prioritize my jobs for today only? I have 5-6 jobs that I would like to run and each would take about 20-30 mins.

Please let me know. Thanks!

Best,
Aashish
