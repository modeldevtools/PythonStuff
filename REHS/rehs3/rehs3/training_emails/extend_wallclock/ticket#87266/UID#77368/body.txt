Hello,

I am writing this email because I would like to increase the time for my job submission. I underestimated the time and would like to increase it from 9 hours to 12 hours.

I used the following command:

| /oasis/scratch/comet/navarrov/temp_project/k-point-opt @ comet-ln3 (navarrov)
| => scontrol update jobid=15593419 TimeLimit=12:00:00

And I got the following error:
Access/permission denied for job 15593419

How could I fix this problem? Thanks in advance.
