Hi there!

We are currently using she shared partition on comet to do some calculation for our project. Our jobs are split into fully parallel, so each job just uses one CPU. We find that the max wall time for the shared partition is two days (48 hours, from the comet tutorial), and sometimes our jobs are not able to finish within two days. We can fix this problem by using multiple cpus, like 2 or 4 for each job. But it will cause some waste of time due to the algorithm inside the code (single-cpu job doesn't have any waste of time). So may I ask if it is possible to extend the max wall time for some of our jobs? I think a temporary extension could solve most of our problems. Please let us know if it is possible, and we will figure out an efficient way to fix the issue.

Thanks,
Zhongxu
