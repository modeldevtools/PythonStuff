I am having trouble with running jobs. Once a job is entered into Comet, it puts it into the queue, then runs the job for about thirty seconds, then terminates it. When I open the log files, they are empty with a file size of 0KB.

I need access to Gaussian in order to run DFT calculations.

-Thank you
