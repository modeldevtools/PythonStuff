Hi --

I have a new set of calculations that I need to run. These are optimization calculations that use quadratic programming and are set up to use IBM's cplex suite. Some of the calculations have taken up to 4 days on local compute resources on 20 physical cores with slightly smaller problems sizes. 

I would like to run these on comet and expect them to take a number of days as well. Unfortunately, as far as my understanding goes, there isn't a checkpointing mechanism for cplex, that would allow me to split up jobs into 48 hour blocks.

Would it be possible to have access to submitting week-long jobs on comet? These are single-node calculations, so I wouldn't request multiple nodes at a time.

If you have alternative ideas (or if you think I am mistaken about checkpointing with cplex!), please let me know.

Thanks,
Shyam
