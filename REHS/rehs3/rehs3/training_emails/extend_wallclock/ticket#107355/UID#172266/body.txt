Hi,

I was wondering if there was a way to receive permissions to run Gaussian 16 jobs longer than one day. It turns out that one day is simply not enough time to finish any of the jobs I have tasked for Comet. The jobs I'd be submitting realistically will take around 5-7 days on at least one node.

Best,
Evan
