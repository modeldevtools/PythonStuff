Hi!

I am about to start a genome annotation that I suspect will complete within 48 hours but may take longer.  I am planning to run the job on one node with 24 threads.  I cannot increase the number of nodes, as the MAKER software can only be run on a single node at this time.  Would it be possible to increase the wall time to 120 hours?  Again, I suspect the job will finish much sooner than that.

Best wishes,

J. Doyle
