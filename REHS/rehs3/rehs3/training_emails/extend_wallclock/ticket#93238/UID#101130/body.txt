Hello,

       I am running a small 1-node Q-Chem job on Comet (Job ID: 18428106).  This is an ADC(2) calculation that (unfortunately) cannot be restarted.

       Would it be possible for a sysadmin to please extend the run time for this job (Job ID: 18428106) for another week?  It is only occupying one node, and we need this benchmark calculation to complete a manuscript.

Thanks,
Prof. Wong
