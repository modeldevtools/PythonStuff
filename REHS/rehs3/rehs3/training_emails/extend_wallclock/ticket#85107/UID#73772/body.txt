Mahidhar,

We have a cap of 48 hours on the CPU time for a job run in the server. But
I may have to submit a job that may take more than 48 hours in the next
week.
May I know the procedures for making this request?
If you can help me in updating the script files( the batch file,env file
and .sh file) for this purpose, that would be really appreciated.

Thanks!

Sincerely,
