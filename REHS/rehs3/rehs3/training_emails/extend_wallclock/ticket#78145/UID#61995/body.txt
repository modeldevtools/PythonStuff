Hi there,

I've sent this email several times, but I just found the email address I left was not working correctly. So I could not receive responses. Here I am again.

I need to run several (about 8) expensive calculations on Comet, each of which requires 300 GB memory and 12 or 16 cores. So I'll have to use the "large-shared" queue.
But 48 hrs wall time is not enough for the calculation and there is no easy way to restart it if it stops. Normally, it could take 5 days (120 hrs) or more to complete.
I was wondering whether there is a way to increase the time limit?

Thanks in advance.
