Hi there,

Recently I am trying to run several long term jobs. The problem with these kind of jobs is that it's not possible to restart the calculation if it stops after the walltime is reached. The standard 48 hours is not enough unfortunately. I've tried to use different number of cores, but it doesn't help much.

I was just wondering, is there any special queue on COMET that allows me to run jobs for a very long time? I don't exactly know how long it could take, but I think 3 or 4 days will be enough.

Thanks in advance.

Best,
He Chen
