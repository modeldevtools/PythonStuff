Greetings,

I am anticipating running a job on 1 node with 24 threads.  I am using the MAKER pipeline to annotate a genome and it is currently only set up to run on a single node.  The job will probably not finish in 48 hours.  Would it be possible to extend the time limit to 7 days?  The job will probably finish in ~5.  I hope to submit the job tomorrow or the next day. 

Best wishes,

J. Doyle
