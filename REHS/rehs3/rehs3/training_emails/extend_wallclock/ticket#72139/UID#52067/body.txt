Hi!

My lab is anticipating running a job on ~3 threads on a single node (it will not multi-thread).  However, we anticipate it requiring significantly more than the 48 hour limit to complete.  Would it be possible to extend the time limit to 5 (or even 7) days for just this job?

Best wishes,

J. Doyle
