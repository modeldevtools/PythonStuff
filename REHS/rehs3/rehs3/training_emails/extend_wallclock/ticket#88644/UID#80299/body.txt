Over the past week, I have experienced a significant increase in the wall time needed to complete jobs compared to a month ago. For instance, on April 9, job #15468372 ran in approximately 19 hours. However, job #16339582, which began on May 17 at 04:15:50 PDT, is currently on pace to just barely finish within the 48-hour wall time limit. I am quite certain that there is nothing in the setup of these jobs that should cause the second one to run so much slower -- they should be essentially the same "size" -- and the job scripts are identical except for the job name.

I have experienced this level of slowdown with all jobs I have submitted in the past week, and it has resulted in many of my jobs terminating prematurely due to the wall time limit. I am wondering if there is a problem with my environment that I have overlooked. Please let me know if there are additional details I can provide to help diagnose this issue.
