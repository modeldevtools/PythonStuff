Hi,

I previously contacted Dr. Mahidhar about restart jobs in abaqus. We recently noticed that our simulations, which uses XFEM and cohesive interface elements, behaves differently when it is submitted as restart job. In other words, if I have a simulation that takes 1000 iterations and used a restart job after 500th iteration, I am having completely two different behaviors when two results beyond 501st increment in both simulations. 


I have attached images showing the difference in the same increment and in the same step time. 

Due to this reason I was wondering If I can have an extended time limit for my simulations?
