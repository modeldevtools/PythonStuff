Hello: 

When I try submitting a job on Comet, sbatch hangs for a while, and then gives an error: 
 
"sbatch: error: slurm_receive_msg: Socket timed out on send/recv operation
sbatch: error: Batch job submission failed: Socket timed out on send/recv operation
squeue: error: slurm_receive_msg: Socket timed out on send/recv operation"

Other users also seem to have this problem. 

Thanks!
