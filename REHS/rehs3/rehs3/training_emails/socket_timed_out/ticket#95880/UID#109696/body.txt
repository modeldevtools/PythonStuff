Dear Concerns,

My comet account name is skundu1. From yesterday I am receiving following message during submission of my jobs:

sbatch: error: slurm_receive_msg: Socket timed out on send/recv operation
sbatch: error: Batch job submission failed: Socket timed out on send/recv operation

Why the jobs are not submitting?
And I am experiencing slow speed of comet. Is there any problem with my account? Please resolve that.
