Hi, when my jobs finish/abort I have email message with job_id such as

SLURM Job_id=22840102 Name=MgO_glyp_CO2_H_TS2 Failed, Run time 12:00:07,
TIMEOUT
But in the run directory there is no job_id file generated anywhere and I
am lost unless I can trace the submission script by name which is tedious.
I wonder if I could  modify VASP submission script somehow to get job_id
created in that folder when the job starts so I can see which job that was
and where

thank you

JB
