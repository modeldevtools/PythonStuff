Hi, I'm having a problem with running cns is batch mode. The cns script works fine on my home workstation, but when I try to run it on comet with the script below, the job starts fine but doesn't seem to finish. I can see some intermediate files generated during the run in the scratch file on the comet node, but the tarred results file is missing all of these intermediate files and also the final output files. 

The slurm output file is as follows(/home/bjnolen/mass_spec/las17/splay/1ewe_fix/slurm-11948975.out):
tar: Removing leading `/' from member names
