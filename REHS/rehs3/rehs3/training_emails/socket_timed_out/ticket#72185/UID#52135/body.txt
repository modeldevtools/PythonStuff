Good afternoon,

I have been experiencing issues over the last day while trying to transfer files from SDSC Comet to our local machines.
The web interface of Globus reports errors of the type "An operation timed out".
When opening the "Details" window, it states:

"Error (connect)\nEndpoint: XSEDE Comet (de463f97-6d04-11e5-ba46-22000b92c6ec)\nServer: oasis-dm.sdsc.xsede.org:2811\nMessage: The operation timed out"

Thank you for your help.
Pierre
