Dear Staff,

I am experiencing issues with submitting jobs on Comet.  When I submit, the
terminal hangs, and there is eventually a message:

sbatch: error: slurm_receive_msg: Socket timed out on send/recv operation
sbatch: error: Batch job submission failed: Socket timed out on send/recv
operation

Thanks,
Anson
