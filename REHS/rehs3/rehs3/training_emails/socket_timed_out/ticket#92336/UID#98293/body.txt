Hello,
Every time I try to submit a job using sbatch, I get an error message. At first it was “Error configuring interconnect” now it just says it’s timing out. I was just submitting jobs about an hour ago so I’m not sure what the problem is. If you’re already aware of this problem, please fix it soon.
