Hello Mahidhar, 

I am trying to submit a job using sbatch and it does not work apparently. It gives me the following: 

[pakserep@comet-ln3 corrected_U9]$ sbatch sc_comet 
sbatch: error: slurm_receive_msg: Socket timed out on send/recv operation
sbatch: error: Batch job submission failed: Socket timed out on send/recv operation

squeue is not working either. Do you know if anything is wrong over there? Thanks
Pedram
