Subject: Comet edit/write files very slow


Hello!

I have some troubles to modify/save files on Comet today (very slow, takes several minute for the wq command in Vi).

Also for job submission:

'sbatch: error: slurm_receive_msg: Socket timed out on send/recv operation
 sbatch: error: Batch job submission failed: Socket timed out on send/recv operation

Please assist.

Thank you!
