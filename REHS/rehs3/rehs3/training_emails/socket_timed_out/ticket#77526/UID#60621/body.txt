I am a new student working on the project 'Laser-based Structural Sensing and Damage Assessment | TG-BCS110001'.  I am having this error (see below) while submitting the job for  in Abaqus. 

<sbatch: error: Batch job submission failed: Socket timed out on send/recv operation
[mithilam@comet-ln2 Concrete_Gill]$>

I was wondering, if I need to be added Abaqus and FORTRAN users to get the licence.
Please let me know the issue.  

Thanks
