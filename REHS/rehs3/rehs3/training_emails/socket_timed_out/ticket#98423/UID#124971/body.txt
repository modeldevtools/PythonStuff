Hello, 

I submitted job number 19724782 which terminated after running for 13.5 hours of CPU time. When this job terminated it did not throw any errors. I submitted the same input file again, job number 19774561, which also terminated after running about 13 hours and did not throw any errors. Can you see any possible reason why this might be? Thank you.
