Hi, I got following error message when submitting the job in COMET:
'sbatch: error: slurm_receive_msg: Socket timed out on send/recv operation
 sbatch: error: Batch job submission failed: Socket timed out on send/recv operation
'
When I tried 'qstat', it said:
perl: error: slurm_receive_msg: Socket timed out on send/recv operation
Problem loading jobs.

Is there a problem with the cluster?

Thanks in advance,
Liuqian
