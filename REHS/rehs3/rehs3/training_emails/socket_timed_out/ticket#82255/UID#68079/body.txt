I have several jobs which are waiting for slurmstepd or something that keep
reporting:

slurmstepd: slurm_receive_msg: Socket timed out on send/recv operation

It seems to have a period of about 5 minutes and collectively they have
reported this over 550 times, thus around 45 hrs collectively...

The job all part of the array job 13899853.

I also can't use any slurm functions from the command line without getting
a similar message.
