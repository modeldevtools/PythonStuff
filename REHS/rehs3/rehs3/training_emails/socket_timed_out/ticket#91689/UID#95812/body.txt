Hello,

Is comet down for some maintenance? I'm having issues while submitting jobs
and when I do squeue to check my jobs I get an error message as: "squeue:
error: slurm_receive_msg: Socket timed out on send/recv operation,
slurm_load_jobs error: Socket timed out on send/recv operation". Please
advise.

Thank you.
