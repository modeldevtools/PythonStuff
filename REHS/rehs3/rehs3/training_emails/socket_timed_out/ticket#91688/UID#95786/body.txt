Dear,
I am trying to run a job on BEAST tool since yesterday, but all jobs that I submitted give me the same error while submitting. I know that the inputs are correct because I already ran the same input days ago and everything went fine.
Below is the error description and attached is my input file.

Thank you in advance for any help.
