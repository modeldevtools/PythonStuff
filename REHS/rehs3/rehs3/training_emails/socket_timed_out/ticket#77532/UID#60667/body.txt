HI, 
 
    I have frequent problems with qstat and sbatch commands, which are very slow. After long waiting the system gives the following replies:

sbatch: error: slurm_receive_msg: Socket timed out on send/recv operation
sbatch: error: Batch job submission failed: Socket timed out on send/recv operation

perl: error: slurm_receive_msg: Socket timed out on send/recv operation
Problem loading jobs.  

    Please advise. 
    Thank you,
