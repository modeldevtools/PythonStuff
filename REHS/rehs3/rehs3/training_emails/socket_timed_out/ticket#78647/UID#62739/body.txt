Hi,

I was trying to get allocation through interactive jobs, but it fails with the following message:

squeue: error: slurm_receive_msg: Socket timed out on send/recv operation
slurm_load_jobs error: Socket timed out on send/recv operation
Job is not Running or Pending. Aborting
scancel: error: slurm_receive_msg: Socket timed out on send/recv operation
scancel: error: slurm_kill_job2() failed Socket timed out on send/recv operation
scancel: error: slurm_receive_msg: Socket timed out on send/recv operation
slurm_load_jobs error: Socket timed out on send/recv operation


The JobIds are : 12483741, 12483730, 12483736, 12483727 and 12483739
Please have a look at it. 

Thanks,
Bikash
