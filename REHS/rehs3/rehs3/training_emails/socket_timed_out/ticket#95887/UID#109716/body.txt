Hello,

The "squeue" command is very slow to respond, as well as the "sbatch" command. In one case, the sbatch command timed out:

sbatch: error: slurm_receive_msg: Socket timed out on send/recv operation
sbatch: error: Batch job submission failed: Socket timed out on send/recv operation

Perhaps the node in charge of scheduling is bogged down.

Thanks,
Mark
