Hi,
  I am having problems checking my job status on Comet. Whenever I typed
squeue -u amira (my account name), it took extremely long time to show job
status and I encountered several times that it showed the error
message: *Socket
timed out on send/recv operation *
  I am not sure what was the problem associate with that.
​  Any suggestions would be helpful.
Best regards,
Yue​
