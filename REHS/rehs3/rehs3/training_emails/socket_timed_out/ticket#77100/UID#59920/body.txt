Hello, 

I am using VASP on the comet cluster and encounter some errors; I can find some information from the standard output, which looks like below. This failure caused my job suspended (but not killed), though the status shown on the job list is "R".

srun: error: slurm_receive_msg: Socket timed out on send/recv operation
srun: Job step creation temporarily disabled, retrying
srun: error: slurm_receive_msg: Socket timed out on send/recv operation
srun: error: slurm_receive_msg: Socket timed out on send/recv operation
srun: error: Unable to create job step: Memory required by task is not available

Would you please help me to check what the problem is?
Thank you very much.

Best 

Geng
