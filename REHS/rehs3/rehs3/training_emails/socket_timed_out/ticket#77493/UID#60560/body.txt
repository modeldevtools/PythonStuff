Hi,

I am trying to submit a job script (located in /home/safari/case35/run). It is same as what I have done many times before. However today it gives me following error:
sbatch: error: slurm_receive_msg: Socket timed out on send/recv operation
sbatch: error: Batch job submission failed: Socket timed out on send/recv operation

Any idea how I should solve this problem?

Thanks!
Mehdi
