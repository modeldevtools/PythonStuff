I am trying to submit some jobs to the computer, I use a bash script to sbatch all the jobs I want. Today it's been really slow to respond to commands like squeue -u, and when I try to submit jobs, its been very slow with a very high failure rate. Some jobs would go through but most would return an error saying sbatch job submission failed.
