[Ticket created from XUP by deman]
[From: David Manosalvas-Kjono]
[System: Comet]
[Category: Operations]
I have been trying to cancel job # 22407671 because it has been hanging for the past few hours, but I am unable to do that. I have tried to cancel it using scancel 3 or 4 times but every time it hangs and after a few moments it says:
[deman@comet-ln3 22407671]$ scancel 22407671
scancel: error: slurm_receive_msg: Socket timed out on send/recv operation
scancel: error: slurm_kill_job2() failed Socket timed out on send/recv operation

A similar thing has been happening if I try to inquire the status of the job using "squeue -u deman"

Is there  something wrong with comet, or with my account?

Thank you for your help!
