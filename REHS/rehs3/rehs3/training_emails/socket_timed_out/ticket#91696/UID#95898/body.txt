Dear XSEDE/Comet staff:
I've tried a few times to submit a job to slurm, and I get the following 
error message both w/ sbatch and squeue.

-----
[falk@comet-ln2 LV4]$ sbatch runB.sb
sbatch: error: slurm_receive_msg: Socket timed out on send/recv operation
sbatch: error: Batch job submission failed: Socket timed out on 
send/recv operation
[falk@comet-ln2 LV4]$
[falk@comet-ln2 LV4]$
[falk@comet-ln2 LV4]$ squeue -u falk
squeue: error: slurm_receive_msg: Socket timed out on send/recv operation
slurm_load_jobs error: Socket timed out on send/recv operation
------

a little searching and it appears that this is likely a network problem

I will continue to periodically check if I can submit jobs, but thought 
you should know - probably already do.
