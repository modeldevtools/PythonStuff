[Category: Batch Queues/Jobs]
Hello,

I'm trying to submit jobs and see the queue on Comet, and I get the following timeout errors:

[groves@comet-ln3 gamma_beta]$ sbatch gamma_beta.sb
sbatch: error: slurm_receive_msg: Socket timed out on send/recv operation
sbatch: error: Batch job submission failed: Socket timed out on send/recv operation
[groves@comet-ln3 gamma_beta]$ squeue
squeue: error: slurm_receive_msg: Socket timed out on send/recv operation
slurm_load_jobs error: Socket timed out on send/recv operation

Both of these commands worked a day ago and I've had no problems viewing the queue and submitting jobs until tonight.

What should I do to get access to the scheduler again?

Thanks!
