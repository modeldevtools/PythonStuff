Mahidhar:
We see these errors on comet on job submission with sbatch from SEAGrid in the last 24 hours.

Was the scheduler down or something.

Thanks,
Sudhakar.

sbatch: error: slurm_receive_msg: Socket timed out on send/recv operation sbatch: error: Batch job submission failed: Socket timed out on send/recv operation
