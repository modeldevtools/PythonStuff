Hi,



Job submission to comet shared and compute nodes failed.

Job submission response from comet [1]

We submit jobs as gridchem community user from SEAGrid.org<http://SEAGrid.org> gateway.

We have ACS workshop (https://sciencegateways.org/-/free-american-chemical-society-acs-workshop-on-science-gateways?inheritRedirect=true&redirect=%2Fcommunity%2Fnews) hands on sessions in the afternoon.
