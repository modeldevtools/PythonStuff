I am attempting to submit a job to comet using the shared partition and I am receiving the following error:

sbatch: error: bank_limit plugin: expired user, can't submit job
sbatch: error: Batch job submission failed: Invalid account or account/partition combination specified

I believe my account should be active since my PI (Qiang Cui) received an allocation beginning on January 1. Can you please clarify if there is another problem?

Thank you,
Daniel
