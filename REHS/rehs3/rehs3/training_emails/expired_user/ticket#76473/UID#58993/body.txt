Hi,

I've been trying to submit jobs but encounter the following error:


sbatch: error: bank_limit plugin: Can't find teragrid association for TG-DMR150064
sbatch: error: Batch job submission failed: Invalid account or account/partition combination specified

The account I use was suppose to expire on the 30th of September, but my PI has extended it for 3 months so that I can utilize my remaining SUs before we submit a renewal request.

Can you please let me know if I need to use a different account charge # in my job submitting script?

Thank you.

Shubham
