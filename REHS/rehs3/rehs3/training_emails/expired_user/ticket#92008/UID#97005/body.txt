Hi,
I just tried to use my xsede account for the first time in a few years and
when I tried to submit a job (sbatch), I was given the error: expired user,
can't submit job
This is surprising since I'm able to upload files, see myself as active on
the xsede website etc... Please let me know how I can reactivate my
account.

Thanks.

Best,
Noëlle
