Hello,

I was trying to submit a job to the queue in Comet.  I used the following script and submitted to the queue:

#!/bin/bash
#PBS -q normal
#PBS -N test
#PBS -l nodes=1:ppn=8
#PBS -l walltime=48:00:00
#PBS -A msu107
#PBS -M jrta1981@gmail.com
#PBS -m abe
#PBS -j oe
#PBS -V

cd $PBS_O_WORKDIR
export GAUSS_SCRDIR=/oasis/scratch/${USER}/${PBS_JOBID}
. /etc/profile.d/modules.sh
module load gaussian
exe=`which g09`
/usr/bin/time $exe < md_1ns-cent_69.gjf > md_1ns-cent_69.log

I got the following error message:

There was an error running the SLURM sbatch command.
The command was:
'/usr/bin/sbatch test9.scr  2>&1'
and the output was:
'sbatch: error: bank_limit plugin: expired user, can't submit job
 sbatch: error: Batch job submission failed: Invalid account or account/partition combination specified
'
Any ideas why the error could be?

Thank you in advance,

Ramon Tusell
