Hi,

Our XSEDE Research request has been renewed (Predicting Atomic-Scale Friction at Experimentally-Accessible Sliding Velocities
Project PI:Martini, Ashlie Charge #:TG-MSS130014) and I should be able to submit jobs to Comet cluster. However, I receive the following error:

sbatch: error: bank_limit plugin: expired user, can't submit job
sbatch: error: Batch job submission failed: Invalid account or account/partition combination specified

I will appreciate it if you help me in this regard.

Best,
Mohammad
