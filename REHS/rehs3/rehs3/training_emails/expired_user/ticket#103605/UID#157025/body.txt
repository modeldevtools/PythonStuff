Hello,

I am one of the users of comet server. My username is smalekia. I have a
problem running the jobs on compute node. Whenever I try to submit a job, I
receive the following error message:

sbatch: error: bank_limit plugin: expired user, can't submit job
sbatch: error: Batch job submission failed: Invalid account or
account/partition combination specified

I will be grateful if you let me know how I can solve this problem.

Thank you,
