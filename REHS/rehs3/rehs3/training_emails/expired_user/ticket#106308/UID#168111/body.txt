[Ticket created from XUP by ffangliu]
[From: Fang Liu]
[System: Comet]
[Category: Batch Queues/Jobs]
Dear Help Desk, our research group has been granted the renewed
  resources on Comet, starting from 4/1. I have reported that I was not able to run batch script because my account was not automatically enrolled in the new allocation. That problem has been resolved. However, as the Co-PI for this allocation, I have received feedbacks from our group members claiming that their account are having the same problem.
  We receive the following error messages when submitting CPU jobs on
  Comet:
sbatch: error: bank_limit plugin: expired user, can't submit job
sbatch: error: Batch job submission failed: Invalid account or
  account/partition combination specified

Could you help fix this or other users? Allocation: TG-CHE140073. Project #: mit136.
