Hello,


I just started receiving an error today whenever I try to submit a batch script. These same scripts with these same input files were working as recently as an hour or two ago, but now I get an error that reads:


sbatch: error: bank_limit plugin: not found user association jmcox2
sbatch: error: Batch job submission failed: Invalid account or account/partition combination specified

every time I try to submit a job. Did something happen to my account information? I'm not sure what to do about this error.


Thanks,


Jordan Cox
