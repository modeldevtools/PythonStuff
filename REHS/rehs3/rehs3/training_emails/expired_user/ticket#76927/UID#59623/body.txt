Hi, 

I logged on to comet today and submitted a job through the following jobscript. 

#!/bin/bash
#SBATCH -J MPIj         
#SBATCH -o output%j.txt    
#SBATCH --ntasks-per-node=24
#SBATCH -N 4             
#SBATCH -n 96               
#SBATCH -p compute        
#SBATCH -t 00:10:00         

source /home/vkotteda/mpi_kokkosserial
ibrun -np 96 /home/vkotteda/mfix_mpi3d_v1p3_all3/mfixtpifpacks

The jobscript submission resulted these two errors:
sbatch: error: bank_limit plugin: expired user, can't submit job
sbatch: error: Batch job submission failed: Invalid account or account/partition combination specified

Could you please help me in resolving this errors. 

I had a startup grant. The computational resources in this grant are going to be expired by today. Is there a way to transfer these resources to my research grant. 

Thank you. 

Sincerely, 
V M Krushnarao Kotteda.
