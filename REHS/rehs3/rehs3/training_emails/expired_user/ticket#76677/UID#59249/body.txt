Dear staff,

I'm trying to submit a job on Comet
(/oasis/scratch/comet/sevoli/temp_project) but I have the following error:

sbatch: error: bank_limit plugin: expired user, can't submit job
sbatch: error: Batch job submission failed: Invalid account or
account/partition combination specified

Could you help me to figure out why?

Best regards,
Stefania
