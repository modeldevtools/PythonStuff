Hi there,

I am trying to submit a Singularity test job on Comet HPC at SDSC via
the batch system but it's throwing me some error which might be related
to my account status on XSEDE. Below is the error that I am getting.

[rfarmer@comet-ln2 ~]$ sbatch -p debug ./test.run
sbatch: error: bank_limit plugin: expired user, can't submit job
sbatch: error: Batch job submission failed: Invalid account or
account/partition combination specified

Any help would be appreciated.

Thanks

Rohit
