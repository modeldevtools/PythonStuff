Dear XSEDE supporting team,

My PI (Rai Navneet) submitted an application for a startup allocation and he added me as a user. The resources we were assigned are Comet GPU and OSG. I tried to submit a job on Comet but I received the following errors. So I was wondering whether I need to apply for a trial account for that specific resource. FYI, my user name is wxk.

The errors I encountered:
sbatch: error: bank_limit plugin: expired user, can't submit job; 
sbatch: error: Batch job submission failed: Invalid account or account/partition combination specified

Thanks for your time.
Best,
Xiaokang
