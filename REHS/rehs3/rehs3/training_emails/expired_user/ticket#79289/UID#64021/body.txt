I am getting the following error when I try to run on P100 using sbatch:

sbatch: error: bank_limit plugin: expired user, can't submit job
sbatch: error: Batch job submission failed: Invalid account or account/partition combination specified

I do have access to the P100 nodes. Here is a part of the slurm script I am using:
#SBATCH --nodes=1
#SBATCH -p gpu
#SBATCH --gres=gpu:p100:4
#SBATCH --ntasks-per-node=4
#SBATCH --export=ALL
#SBATCH -A TG-MCA03S012
#SBATCH -t 00:05:00
