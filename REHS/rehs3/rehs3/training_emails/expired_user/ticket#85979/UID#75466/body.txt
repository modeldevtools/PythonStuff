[Category: Batch Queues/Jobs]
I am unable to submit jobs to Comet.

command: sbatch myjob768

error:
sbatch: error: bank_limit plugin: expired user, can't submit job
sbatch: error: Batch job submission failed: Invalid account or account/partition combination specified

This job script has worked hundreds of times previously.

Could it have something to do with the start of the new allocation cycle?
