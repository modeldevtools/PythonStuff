Dear,


I am trying to run calculations on Comet but I am getting this error message:


"sbatch: error: bank_limit plugin: expired user, can't submit job

sbatch: error: Batch job submission failed: Invalid account or account/partition combination specified"


Would you mind to please help me out how to overcome this problem? This would be much appreciated, thanks.

The XSEDE website is also in maintenance, so I am not sure  if I should do something else there.

Thanks,

Thanks!
