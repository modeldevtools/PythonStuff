Hi,

I cannot launch jobs on Comet due to following errors. 

sbatch: error: bank_limit plugin: expired user, can't submit job
sbatch: error: Batch job submission failed: Invalid account or account/partition combination specified


Why did my username expire? I can see the Comet allocations on portal.xsede.org <http://portal.xsede.org/> . My Comet and Xsede username is balaban



Best Regards,
-Metin
