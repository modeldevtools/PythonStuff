Hi, I (UN: nguros) was recently re-added to my advisers Comet (SDSC)
allocation, however I am still unable to submit a job. I can see I am an
added user with SUs available under project MDA123, however I am still
getting the error message:

sbatch: error: bank_limit plugin: expired user, can't submit job
sbatch: error: Batch job submission failed: Invalid account or
account/partition combination specified

when I try to submit a job to that project. If he just re-added me today,
will it take time to start working? Thanks for your help,
Nick
