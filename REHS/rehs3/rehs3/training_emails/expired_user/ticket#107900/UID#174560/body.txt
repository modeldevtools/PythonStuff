Dear help team,

When I was to dataset processing job today I surprisingly found that:

                sbatch: error: bank_limit plugin: expired user, can't submit job
                sbatch: error: Batch job submission failed: Invalid account or account/partition combination specified

and the `show_accounts` command yields:

                No accounts found for user kkew on platform sdsc_comet.

My current concerns are:

1. Why does it stop serving?
2. How to continue the use of COMET?
3. Will my data at LUSTURE_SCRATCH file system (/oasis/scratch/comet/kkew/temp_project/) and home directory (/home/kkew/) get wiped out?

Thank you so much!

Yours sincerely,
Kaiwen Wu
