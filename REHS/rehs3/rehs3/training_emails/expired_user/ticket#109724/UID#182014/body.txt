Hi 
Whenever, I am trying to submit the job, I am getting the error below in my account.

sbatch: error: bank_limit plugin: not found user association sahota86
sbatch: error: Batch job submission failed: Invalid account or account/partition combination specified

I couldn't understand what this error is regarding?

Thanks and regards.
Pankaj
