Dear Sir or Madam,

I am trying to run some jobs on commet using gpus.
I get the following error:

sbatch: error: bank_limit plugin: expired user, can't submit job
sbatch: error: Batch job submission failed: Invalid account or account/partition combination specified

could you please help me with this.
FYI: I have trial allocation on commet.

Best regards,
Zahra
