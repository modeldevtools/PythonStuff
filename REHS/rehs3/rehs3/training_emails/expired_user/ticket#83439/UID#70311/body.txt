Hi there,

I am trying to use GPU on Comet. The following error is returned after I submit a job:

sbatch: error: bank_limit plugin: expired user, can't submit job
sbatch: error: Batch job submission failed: Invalid account or account/partition combination specified

If I type "show_accounts", it shows:

ID name      project      used     available    used_by_proj
------------------------------------------------------------
chenhe       scr102       0        1206064      3165

So it seems there are plenty resources that I should be able to use. Could you help to check how to reactivate my account?

Thanks in advance.
