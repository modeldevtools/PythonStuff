Hello,
I tried to run some jobs not using GPUs on Comet. And, my submission was denied because I do not have permission to submit a job on "compute" queue. 
So, can you authorize me to use CPU nodes?

Followings are the error message.
"""
sbatch: error: bank_limit plugin: expired user, can't submit job
sbatch: error: Batch job submission failed: Invalid account or account/partition combination specified
"""
