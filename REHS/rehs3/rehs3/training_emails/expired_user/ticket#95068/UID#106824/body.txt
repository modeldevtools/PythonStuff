[Category: Trial Account]
Dear Xsede, 

Could we get some comet cpu allocation for the current trial account? 
We want to set up the virtual environment to use pytorch and tensorflow, and we run the command: 
srun --partition=debug --pty --nodes=1 -ntasks-per-node=4 -t 00:30:00 --wait=0 --export=ALL

Then it shows us the error messages: bank_limit_plugin: expired user, can't submit job, unable to allocate the resources. 

Is that possible to get some comet cpu allocations as well?
account is: bopang@comet.sdsc.xsede.org
Thanks, 
Bo pang
