I just started to use Comet, compiled miniconda and OpenMM. I tried to check the compilation with a short job. When I send the job by  sbatch testpy.job, I received the following error:

sbatch: error: bank_limit plugin: expired user, can't submit job
sbatch: error: Batch job submission failed: Invalid account or account/partition combination specified

I see the same error when I ask for an interactive job on partition debug as defined in the User Guide. I have attached the test script I  tried to run.

I very much appreciate your help to resolve this issue. Thank you.
