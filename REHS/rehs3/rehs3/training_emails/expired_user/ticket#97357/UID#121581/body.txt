Hello Help Desk,

I cannot use the sbatch on Comet, but we have a valid extension to 2019-3-31 with Charge to #TG-CIE170034.

The message I got when I submit jobs using sbatch is:
sbatch: error: bank_limit plugin: expired user, can't submit job
sbatch: error: Batch job submission failed: Invalid account or account/partition combination specified

Would you please help me to solve this? Thanks.

Best,
Chaoran
