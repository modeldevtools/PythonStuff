Dear XSEDE supporting team,

I have an account on Comet under the project id: TG-BIO180012 (My account
is wxk) . I was trying to submit a job to Comet but I run into this error:
sbatch: error: bank_limit plugin: expired user, can't submit job
sbatch: error: Batch job submission failed: Invalid account or
account/partition combination specified

I checked my account on the user portal website and my account is still
active. Do you know what this error means?

*FYI*: the specification for my job:
#SBATCH -p shared
#SBATCH -N 1
#SBATCH -c 8
#SBATCH -t 24:00:00
#SBATCH -o /output/slurm.%N.%j.out
#SBATCH -e /output/slurm.%N.%j.err
module load R/3.4.0
srun -n 1 Rscript ../Three_in_One/main.R starting_size_v9_700.csv 2

Thanks for your time.

Best regards,
Xiaokang
