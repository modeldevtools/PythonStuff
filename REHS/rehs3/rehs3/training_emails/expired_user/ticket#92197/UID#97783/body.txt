Hi,

We have been allocates some GPU computing time yesterday but I am unable to access the GPU resources on Comet. I am attaching the bash script I am using to submit a job. I get the following error when I try to submit this bash script "sbatch: error: Batch job submission failed: Invalid account or account/partition combination specified".

It seems like the GPU allocation has not been activated yet but it shows up in my XSEDE User Portal account. Could you please take a look at it?

Thanks,
Arashdeep
