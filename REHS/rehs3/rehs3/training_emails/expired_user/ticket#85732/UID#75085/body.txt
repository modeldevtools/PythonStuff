Hi,

I have problem of submitting jobs on comet:

sbatch: error: bank_limit plugin: expired user, can't submit job
sbatch: error: Batch job submission failed: Invalid account or account/partition combination specified

And

No accounts found for user yhuang1 on platform sdsc_comet.

Could you please help me with this problem?

Thanks and best regards,
Yuanhang
