Hi,

I got an error when running the SLURM sbatch command:
the command was:
'/usr/bin/sbatch /oasis/scratch/comet/liuqian/temp_project/output/GOM/autorun/out/20170913T075644/gom_20170913T075644_0001runfile.sh  2>&1'
and the output was:
'sbatch: error: bank_limit plugin: not found user association liuqian
 sbatch: error: Batch job submission failed: Invalid account or account/partition combination specified
'
Thanks in advance for helping me out!
Liuqian
