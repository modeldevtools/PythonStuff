Hi,

I was just been approved for access Comet with 1000 SU allocation (will be expired on Nov. 2018). However, when I try to do the following at comet:

srun --partition=debug --pty --nodes=1 --ntasks-per-node=24 -t 00:30:00 --wait=0 --export=ALL /bin/bash

The system response with following:

srun: error: bank_limit plugin: expired user, can't submit job
srun: error: Unable to allocate resources: Invalid account or account/partition combination specified

Could you please help me to fix this problem? Thanks!

Best Regards,
Chong
