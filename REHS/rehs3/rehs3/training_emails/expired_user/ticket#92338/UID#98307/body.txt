Hi,

When I try to submit a batch job on comet I get the following error on both the debug and normal partition:

sbatch: error: bank_limit plugin: not found user association ahogan2
sbatch: error: Batch job submission failed: Invalid account or account/partition combination specified

This is the submission script:

#!/bin/bash
#SBATCH --job-name="df sapt"
#SBATCH --output="job.%j.%N.out"
#SBATCH --partition=compute
#SBATCH --nodes=1
#SBATCH --ntasks-per-node=24
#SBATCH --export=ALL
#SBATCH -t 00:30:00
[...]

Can you tell me what's wrong?

Thanks,
Adam
