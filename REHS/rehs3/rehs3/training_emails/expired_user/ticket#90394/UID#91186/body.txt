Hi,

I am added to the account, TG-MSS160003, but I get the following error when I submit a job on comet.
It seems related to that I used to use comet via another account.


%%%%%%%%%    

>>sbatch comet.slurm
>>sbatch: error: bank_limit plugin: expired user, can't submit job
>>sbatch: error: Batch job submission failed: Invalid account or account/partition combination specified

%%%%%%%%%    comet.slurm  %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
#!/bin/bash  
#SBATCH --job-name="comet"
#SBATCH --output="comet.%j.out"  
#SBATCH --partition=compute  
#SBATCH --nodes=10
#SBATCH --ntasks-per-node=24
#SBATCH --export=ALL  
#SBATCH -t 48:00:00  

#SBATCH -A TG-MSS160003

#ibrun in verbose mode will give binding detail  

ibrun -v ./main


Could you help me, please?

Thank you,
Koki Sagiyama
