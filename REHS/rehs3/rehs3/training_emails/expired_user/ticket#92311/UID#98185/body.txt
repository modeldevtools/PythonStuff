Hi:


I just received word on Tuesday that I have been awarded a 10% advance on my applied-for Research Allocation. I believe it should be working since:


[skimble5@comet-ln3 k1rep1]$ show_accounts
ID name      project      used     available    used_by_proj
------------------------------------------------------------
skimble5     tow103       0        40000        0

To charge your job to one of these projects replace  << project >>
with one from the list and put this Slurm directive in your job script:
#SBATCH -A << project >>


but then I get:


[skimble5@comet-ln3 k1rep1]$ sbatch structurejobsubmissionfile_one_run.sh
sbatch: error: bank_limit plugin: expired user, can't submit job
sbatch: error: Batch job submission failed: Invalid account or account/partition combination specified

The structurejobsubmissionfile_one_run.sh is:


#!/bin/bash
#SBATCH -A tow103
#SBATCH --job-name="STRUCTURE"
#SBATCH --output="STRUCTURE.%j.%N.1node24cores.out"
#SBATCH --partition=compute
#SBATCH --nodes=1
#SBATCH --ntasks-per-node=24
#SBATCH --export=ALL
#SBATCH -t 06:00:00
/share/apps/compute/structure/bin/structure


Any suggestions?


Thanks,

Steve
