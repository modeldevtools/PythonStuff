Hello,
I have been encountering the following error whenever I try to submit a job
to Comet:

sbatch: error: bank_limit plugin: user is disallowed to submit jobs

sbatch: error: Batch job submission failed: Invalid account or
account/partition combination specified


There are currently other jobs running properly on comet. What could be
causing this error?


Sincerely,
Robert T. Martin
