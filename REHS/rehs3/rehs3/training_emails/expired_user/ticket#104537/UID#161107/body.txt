Hi, I am a user on Prof. Heather Kulik's educational allocation (mit127). When I go to use the educational allocation on comet, I am denied with the following error:

sbatch: error: bank_limit plugin: expired user, can't submit job
sbatch: error: Batch job submission failed: Invalid account or account/partition combination

I used #SBATCH -A mit127 and #SBATCH -p shared
