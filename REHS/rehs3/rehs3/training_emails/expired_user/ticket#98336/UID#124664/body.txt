I'm trying to an interactive job with a Pascal GPU (or any GPU) on Comet. However, the scheduler is rejecting my requests.
`
$ salloc -A lal106 --partition=gpu --nodes=1 --ntasks-per-node=1 --gres=gpu:p100:1  --time=1:00:00                                                                                          
salloc: error: bank_limit plugin: expired user, can't submit job
salloc: error: Job submit/allocate failed: Invalid account or account/partition combination specified
`
I'm able to get jobs in the compute and debug queues though, and the collaborator I'm working with is able to get time. Do I need to be in some group to be able to get GPU time?
