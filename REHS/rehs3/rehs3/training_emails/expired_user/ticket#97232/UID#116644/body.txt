Hi,
When I submit a task through sbatch, the system gives the following error
message:

sbatch: error: bank_limit plugin: expired user, can't submit job

sbatch: error: Batch job submission failed: Invalid account or
account/partition combination specified




Could you help me to figure it out?

Attached are scripts for your reference.


Thanks!


Best,


Fei
