I am unable to submit jobs to the gpu-shared queue since today morning. The error that I get while trying to submit the job is as follows,

sbatch: error: bank_limit plugin: expired user, can't submit job
sbatch: error: Batch job submission failed: Invalid account or account/partition combination specified

I think I have sufficient time on the gpu queue. Also, everything was working correctly till Friday. I have attached my submission script.
