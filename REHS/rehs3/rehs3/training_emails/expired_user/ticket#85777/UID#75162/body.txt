Hi All,

I am equilibrating a system using Gromacs on COMET.
This equilibration can only be done using Gromacs version 4 on CPUs. This is because we are using specific distance restraints that are not supported by the newest versions of Gromacs on GPUs, because of a problem with the domain decomposition. We have already investigated this for long time with the help of the XSEDE people.

However, this morning, I was trying to submit the job and it was not working with the following error:

sbatch: error: bank_limit plugin: expired user, can't submit job
sbatch: error: Batch job submission failed: Invalid account or account/partition combination specified

I am using the account ddp245 (belonging to Prof. McCammon, who is my post-doctoral advisor), which has time on CPUs. As you see, there is still a lot on this account:

ID name      project      used     available    used_by_proj
------------------------------------------------------------
gpalermo     ddp245       1372994  2005586      1372994

Can we solve this issue?

Thank you very much
Giulia
