Hello,

I'm submitting a job on the Comet machine and receive the following error:

sbatch: error: bank_limit plugin: expired user, can't submit job
sbatch: error: Batch job submission failed: Invalid account or account/partition combination specified

Here is my working directroy:
/oasis/scratch/comet/bghudson/temp_project/Ucalc/Corundum/Ti

I'm an active user and should be able to access this account.
#SBATCH -A iwa117

Are there any modifications I need to be able to submit jobs to Comet?

Thanks,
Blake Hudson
