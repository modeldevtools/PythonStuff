Dear Sir/Madam,

I am Shaini, a PhD student at NJIT.
I have a problem regarding the submission of job to a comet.sdsc.xsede.org
.

Following statement is stated as an error message:
[shaini@comet-ln3 LAMMPS]$ sbatch lammps-slurm.sb
*sbatch: error: bank_limit plugin: expired user, can't submit job*
*sbatch: error: Batch job submission failed: Invalid account or
account/partition combination specified*
[shaini@comet-ln3 LAMMPS]$

I have not used the cluster for a time after I have taken the access and
this might be the reason for this error. Hereafter I am going to use the
XSEDE resources continuously. (Note:the allocation time has not expired and
it will be last till June 2019).

Please kindly help me with solving this issue.

Thank you very much for your kind consideration,
Yours Sincerely,
Shaini Dilsha.
