Hi, 

I'm trying to run a script using putty on the xsede comet hostname but I'm getting the error message:

[osaad@comet-ln3 temp_project]$ sbatch GDCDownloadScript.txt
sbatch: error: bank_limit plugin: expired user, can't submit job
sbatch: error: Batch job submission failed: Invalid account or account/partition combination specified

Why is it saying expired user, can't submit job?

Thanks,

Omar
