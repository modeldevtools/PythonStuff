Hi,

I am the allocation managed for a recently approved Startup Allocation "Using High Resolution Imagery and Neural Networks to Measure Destruction and Reconstruction after a Natural Disaster." We use Comet-GPU. Right now, when I try to submit a job on Comet, it throws the error: "sbatch: error: bank_limit plugin: user is disallowed to submit jobs
sbatch: error: Batch job submission failed: Invalid account or account/partition combination specified". Why would I be getting this?

Additionally, I just wanted to clarify one thing about our Startup allocation. We applied and were approved for 2500 GPU hours on Comet-GPU, but for some reason XSEDE lists the allocation at 2500 SUs, which I know are not in 1-1 correspondence with GPU hours; in fact I was under the impression that 2500 GPU hours correlates to about 50,000 SUs. Is this an error, or am I mistaken? Thanks so much for your help.
