Dear colleagues,

When I submitted job just now using sbatch command, I got these following errors:

sbatch: error: bank_limit plugin: error talking to slurm, please try again
sbatch: error: Batch job submission failed: Error configuring interconnect

The same job script worked well about two hours ago. Is there any connect problem of the slurm job system?

Bests
