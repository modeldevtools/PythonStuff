Hello,

I have my allocation on Comet, however, when I logged in today to run some simulations, the slurm manager failed and showed the message: 
sbatch: error: bank_limit plugin: expired user, can't submit job
sbatch: error: Batch job submission failed: Invalid account or account/partition combination specified

This is strange because I was allotted a new Research Allocation. Could you please check the status of my account. 

Thank you,
Arun
