[Ticket created from XUP by dhorkel]

[System: Comet]
[Category: Accounts]
Hello,

My account is currently not associated with the rest of my research group whose email addresses are: marthac@temple.edu,k.hadjiyiannakou@cyi.ac.cy.

 When I use "show_accounts" I get the message:

"No accounts found for user dhorkel on platform sdsc_comet."

when my collaborator tries to run in interactive mode he gets the error:

"srun: error: bank_limit plugin: expired user, can't submit job
srun: error: Unable to allocate resources: Invalid account or
account/partition combination specified"

and it seems we aren't authorized to change our accounts.

Thank you for the help.
