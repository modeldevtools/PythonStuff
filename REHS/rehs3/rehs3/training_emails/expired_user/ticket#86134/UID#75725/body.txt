Hello,

I'm having issues with my account. When I submit a job I get this message.

[dnocito@comet-ln2 240]$ qsub submit.sh 
There was an error running the SLURM sbatch command.
The command was:
'/usr/bin/sbatch submit.sh  2>&1'
and the output was:
'sbatch: error: bank_limit plugin: expired user, can't submit job
 sbatch: error: Batch job submission failed: Invalid account or account/partition combination specified

So I went to check which account I'm on 

[dnocito@comet-ln2 240]$ show_accounts
ID name      project      used     available    used_by_proj
------------------------------------------------------------

No accounts found for user dnocito on platform sdsc_comet.

My PI has shown me a screen shot which I have attached and says I should be on his account, but that doesn't seem to be the case on Comet.
