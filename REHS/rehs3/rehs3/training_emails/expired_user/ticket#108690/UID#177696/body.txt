Good evening,

I hope this email finds you well.

My XSEDE username is tbeucler and I have a healthy allocation on Comet GPU.
I can easily request interactive CPU nodes but I get the error pasted below
when requesting an interactive GPU node.

Would it be possible to set up GPU access for my account?

**** Example error *****
When running 'srun -A sio134 --partition=gpu-shared --pty --nodes=1
--ntasks-per-node=6 --gres=gpu:k80:1 -t 02:00:00 --wait=0 --export=ALL
/bin/bash'

I get the following error:


*srun: error: bank_limit plugin: expired user, can't submit jobsrun: error:
Unable to allocate resources: Invalid account or account/partition
combination specified*

***********

Let me know if you need additional information and I hope you have a great
evening.
