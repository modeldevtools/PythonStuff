Dear officer,

Hello!

My account is zhihui@comet.sdsc.xsede.org <mailto:zhihui@comet.sdsc.xsede.org> and I cannot use it since this month. It shows I am an expired user. My advisor is Professor Osvaldo Gutierrez and he said he has added me to the list. Could you please help me with submitting jobs?

Thank you!
Zhihui
