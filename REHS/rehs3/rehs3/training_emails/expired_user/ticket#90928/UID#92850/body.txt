When I attempt to submit a jobscript to the system, I receive the following error:

"sbatch: error: bank_limit plugin: expired user, can't submit job
sbatch: error: Batch job submission failed: Invalid account or account/partition combination specified"

This is occurring for me and the other group members in my project. In our supervisor's system it shows that we are listed under his active project.
