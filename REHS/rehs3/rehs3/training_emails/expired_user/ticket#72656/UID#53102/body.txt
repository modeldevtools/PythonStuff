Hello XSEDE Help Desk,

I have recently been submitting jobs to the Comet GPU queue, but this morning I have encountered an issue submitting tasks.  Namely, I receive the following error:

"sbatch: error: Batch job submission failed: Invalid account or account/partition combination specified"

I am requesting either the "gpu" or "gpu-shared" partition under the account "ddp194", which is our lab's gpu allocation that I have access to according to the "show_accounts" command. I am specifically asking for either 4 P100's (gpu) or 1 P100 (gpu-shared).

If you could offer any assistance, it would be greatly appreciated.  Please let me know if I can provide you with any further information.

Take care,
Sam Bowerman
