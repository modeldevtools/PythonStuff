Hello,

Our group recently resubmitted a proposal for more time on Comet, and it was accepted. However, when I submit a job with 'sbatch', I get the following output:
sbatch: error: bank_limit plugin: expired user, can't submit job
sbatch: error: Batch job submission failed: Invalid account or account/partition combination specified

What is the solution to this issue? 
Thanks!
