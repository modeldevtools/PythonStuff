Hi XSEDE help,

I am a current user on Comet cluster under username stingw. My PI is Prof.
George Porter.

I can log into Comet but my account seems to be suspended. I ran
show_accounts and got the following message:
"No accounts found for user stingw on platform sdsc_comet".

Is there anything I can do to restore my account?

Thanks,
Shu-Ting
