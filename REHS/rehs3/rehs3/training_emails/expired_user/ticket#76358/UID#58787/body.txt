Hi,

My colleague Will East and I are trying to submit jobs on comet but we can't. We both get the following error message when doing so

sbatch: error: bank_limit plugin: expired user, can't submit job
sbatch: error: Batch job submission failed: Invalid account or account/partition combination specified

Its seems that this is an issue with Comet, because we should have sufficient time in our allocation and
we were able to submit jobs up until yesterday. Can you please let us know what is causing this error?

Sincerely,

Vasilis
