Hello,

I had the code running on Comet last June with a trial allocation (Mahidhar Tatineni helped me to get it running). I have now been given a research allocation and tried to run the code, but get the following error message:

[sim123@comet-ln3 DeepSpeech]$ sbatch deepspeech-gpushared.sb 
sbatch: error: bank_limit plugin: expired user, can't submit job
sbatch: error: Batch job submission failed: Invalid account or account/partition combination specified

Please let me know what I am doing wrong.

Many thanks,

Simone
