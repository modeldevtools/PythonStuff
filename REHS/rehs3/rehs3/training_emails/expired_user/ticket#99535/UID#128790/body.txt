Hi,

I wanted to submit job at COMET but I got this error:

sbatch: error: bank_limit plugin: expired user, can't submit job
sbatch: error: Batch job submission failed: Invalid account or account/partition combination specified

Maybe that is because I am new user. this is my job:

#!/bin/bash  
#SBATCH --job-name="m9"
#SBATCH --output="z1.out"
#SBATCH --error="z1.err"    
#SBATCH --partition=compute
#SBATCH --nodes=11
#SBATCH --ntasks-per-node=24
#SBATCH --export=ALL
#SBATCH -t 47:10:00
#SBATCH -A mai103

ibrun -np 256 -v ./Xvicar3dPAT-2.3.2

Thank you for your time. I look forward to your reply.

Regards,
Dariush
