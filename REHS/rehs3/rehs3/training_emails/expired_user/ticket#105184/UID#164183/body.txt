[Ticket created from XUP by arosen]
[From: Andrew Rosen]
[System: Comet]
[Category: Trial Account]
I just received a Comet trial account. However, I am unable to submit jobs. When attempting to `sbatch` a job, I get 

``
sbatch: error: bank_limit plugin: not found user association arosen
sbatch: error: Batch job submission failed: Invalid account or account/partition combination specified
``

Indeed, when using `show_accounts`, I get back `No accounts found for user arosen on platform sdsc_comet.` So, it seems like something may not be fully set up. Could you help me with this? I can't "add a user" to the project because it's a trial account of which I am not the PI (I have a separate account on Stampede2 where I am the co-PI).
