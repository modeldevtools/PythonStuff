My allocation (TG-BIO170014) recently expired. I am also in a Champion Allocation (TG-TRA150017), however when I try to run jobs using the champion allocation, I keep getting the error:

sbatch: error: bank_limit plugin: expired user, can't submit job
sbatch: error: Batch job submission failed: Invalid account or account/partition combination specified

Can you offer any advice please?

Thanks!
