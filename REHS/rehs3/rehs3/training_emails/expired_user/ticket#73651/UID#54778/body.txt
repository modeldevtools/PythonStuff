Hi,

I'm trying to submit a GPU job, but I'm getting the following error:

[nano3@comet-ln3 DBI_contact4_angle]$ sbatch submit.sh 
sbatch: error: bank_limit plugin: expired user, can't submit job
sbatch: error: Batch job submission failed: Invalid account or account/partition combination specified

The submission script is as follows:

#!/bin/bash
#SBATCH --job-name="DBIc4ang"
#SBATCH --output=out.dat
#SBATCH --nodes=1
#SBATCH --ntasks-per-node=4
#SBATCH --no-requeue
#SBATCH -p gpu
#SBATCH --gres=gpu:4
#SBATCH -t 48:00:00
#SBATCH -A TG-DMR150103

export OMP_NUM_THREADS=6
module unload intel
module load gromacs

ibrun gmx_mpi mdrun -v -deffnm npt

Note that we have recently transferred most of our SUs to GPU SUs and this is the first time I'm trying to use the GPU SUs.

Best,
Irem
