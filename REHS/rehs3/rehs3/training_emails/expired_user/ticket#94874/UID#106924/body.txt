Hello,

I am trying to submit a job using sbatch and I receive the following error message when I try to submit to gpu or gpu-shared:

sbatch: error: bank_limit plugin: expired user, can't submit job
sbatch: error: Batch job submission failed: Invalid account or account/partition combination specified

Although I only have a trial account, I believe it's good for up to 100 GPU hours, but please let me know if it is not.

Best,
Mario
