Hello,

My PI recently had 40000 CPU units moved to GPU units and now I can't seem to submit jobs to the GPU nodes.  This is the error that I receive:


[tdodd3@comet-ln3 Snapshots]$ sbatch run_prod1
sbatch: error: Batch job submission failed: Job has invalid qos

I have attached the job submission script.  I would like to resolve this quickly since our allocation ends in September.  Thanks in advance.

Best,

Thomas
