Hi there, 

I opened a ticket yesterday about login and home folder issue. Which was resolved. Thanks. 

Now I have my home folder and can create folders. I was added to my project yesterday which is visible when I login to my online profile. But when I try to submit a job using sbatch it gives me the following error. 

sbatch: error: bank_limit plugin: expired user, can't submit job
sbatch: error: Batch job submission failed: Invalid account or account/partition combination specified

I am using my project code uot156 in my batchfile. Can you please check what can be the cause of this problem ?

Sincerely,
Ratul Paul.
