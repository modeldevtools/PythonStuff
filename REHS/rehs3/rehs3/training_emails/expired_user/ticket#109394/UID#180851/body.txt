Dear Sir or Madam,

I am trying to submit jobs on Comet GPU, and get the following error
messages:

sbatch: error: bank_limit plugin: user is disallowed to submit jobs
sbatch: error: Batch job submission failed: Invalid account or
account/partition combination specified

I successfully submitted my job yesterday using the same job script I am
trying now. I would appreciate it if you could help me with this. Attached
please find my job script. Thank you very much!

Best regards,
Fengyi
