Hi there, 

I have received this error when I try to submit a job to a queue. Could you let me know exactly what it means? 

sbatch: error: bank_limit plugin: expired user, can't submit job
sbatch: error: Batch job submission failed: Invalid account or account/partition combination specified

Thanks a lot,
Danielle Skinner
