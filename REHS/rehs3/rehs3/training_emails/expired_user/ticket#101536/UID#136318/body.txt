Hey Sir,
I want to submit a job in Comet, but it looks like that I am not permitted to submit a job. The pbs I used and the error I am getting afterwards are as follow:

PBS:
"
#!/bin/sh

#PBS -N test
#PBS -q compute
#PBS -V
#PBS -l nodes=1:ppn=24 -l walltime=00:20:00
#
# Batch-submission script for OpenPBS system
#
#SBATCH -A TG-MCB100145

module load gromacs
# cd $PBS_O_WORKDIR #change to the working directory
export  OMP_NUM_THREADS=4

cat $SLURM_NODEFILE

mpirun -np 6 gmx_mpi mdrun -deffnm npt_heavyatoms -ntomp 4 -cpi npt_heavyatoms.cpt
"
And the error:
"
The command was:
'/usr/bin/sbatch test.pbs  2>&1'
and the output was:
'sbatch: error: bank_limit plugin: expired user, can't submit job
 sbatch: error: Batch job submission failed: Invalid account or account/partition combination specified
"
The pbs file works on another user account existing on comet.
I would be very appreciated if you help me with this issue.
Thank you,
Shima Arasteh
