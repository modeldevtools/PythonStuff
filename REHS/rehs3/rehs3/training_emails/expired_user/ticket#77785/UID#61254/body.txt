Hi Comet-Gpu Team, 

I was testing NAMD-GPU on comet using the example provided at: /share/apps/examples/NAMD/GPU, but failed. I got an error, saying:
sbatch: error: bank_limit plugin: expired user, can't submit job
sbatch: error: Batch job submission failed: Invalid account or account/partition combination specified. 

(Please see the screenshot attached as well). 

Would you please help to take a look? Thanks in advance. 

Best,
hongjing
