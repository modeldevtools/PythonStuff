Hello,
I attempted to submit a job through Comet, and received the message: 

 'sbatch: error: bank_limit plugin: expired user, can't submit job
 sbatch: error: Batch job submission failed: Invalid account or account/partition combination specified

I have previously submitted jobs and I have not used any of the allocation recently. Please let me know any potential solutions to this issue. Thank you.
