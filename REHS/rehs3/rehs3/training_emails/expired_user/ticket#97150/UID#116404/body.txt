Hi,

I opened a ticket a week or two ago about our allocation not propagating to Comet.  For all but myself, it was just a matter of renewing the users and waiting for the change to propagate.  However, there seems to be an issue somewhere else for me.  I just tried to run a job and got the sbatch error "bank_limit blugin: expired user, can't submit job", and sure enough, show_accounts still didn't list any allocations.

Any idea what's going on?  My Comet username is gabej if it's needed.

Best,
Gabe
