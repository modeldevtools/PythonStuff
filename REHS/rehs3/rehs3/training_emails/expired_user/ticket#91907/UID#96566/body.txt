I was trying to run few ABAQUS jobs on XSEDE Comet. 
I could log in to the system through Putty. But when I submit the job, I am getting the following error.

sbatch: error: bank_limit plugin: not found user association mithilam
sbatch: error: Batch job submission failed: Invalid account or account/partition

Thanks
