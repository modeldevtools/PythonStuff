Hi, 

I am getting the following error while trying to run a batch job using
sbatch /home/nsanyal/Prediction/Clozapine/TEST/test.Batch. What exactly is causing the error?

sbatch: error: bank_limit plugin: expired user, can't submit job
sbatch: error: Batch job submission failed: Invalid account or account/partition combination specified

Thanks,
Nilotpal
