Good morning,

I am writing regarding an issue with comet job submission. I am receiving this error message:

sbatch: error: bank_limit plugin: expired user, can't submit job
sbatch: error: Batch job submission failed: Invalid account or account/partition combination specified

What should I do?

Thanks a lot,
cecilia Bores
