Dear XSEDE Help,


I am not able to submit jobs on comet as of today. My account is current under extension, and I am using the remainder hours to generate scaling data for the present allocation opportunity (October 15).


The extension was activated past Friday and after COMET got back from the power outage, I was able to submit jobs. Also, for your information, as of this morning I got approved for a trial allocation for using GPUs on COMET. This was result of a proposed supplement to the present research allocation that I submitted past Friday.


As of this morning I cannot submit any jobs. I get the following error:


sbatch: error: bank_limit plugin: user is disallowed to submit jobs
sbatch: error: Batch job submission failed: Invalid account or account/partition combination specified


Do I need to modify my job scripts? Is this error due to conflicts with GPU allocation?


I'll appreciate any help.


Warm regards,

Amnaya
