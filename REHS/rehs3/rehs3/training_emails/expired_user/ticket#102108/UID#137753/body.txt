[Ticket created from XUP by pfliuiuc]
[From: Pengfei Li]
[System: Comet GPU]
[Category: Allocations]
Dear Sir or Madam,

We have got approved about the transfer request of 400,000 CPU SUs to 28,571.0 GPU SUs on Comet on last Thursday (01/10) for the MCB120097 allocations. And the email said it could take up to five days for our accounts to be active. However, we can not use the GPU resources after seven days passed. I got the following error for submitting a gpu job:

sbatch: error: bank_limit plugin: expired user, can't submit job
sbatch: error: Batch job submission failed: Invalid account or account/partition combination specified

Can you help to check what is wrong? Thanks!

Best regards,
Pengfei
