I am xinye zheng. My ID on Comet GPU is xinye. I would like to ask my account information because I currently cannot run on Comet GPU. When I submitted a job, it shows:

sbatch: error: bank_limit plugin: not found user association xinye
sbatch: error: Batch job submission failed: Invalid account or account/partition combination specified

But my advisor said I should have access to the allocation expires next year. Could you help me take a look? Thanks!
