Hi, I submitted a job, but it shows :
The command was:
'/usr/bin/sbatch runjob_comet  2>&1'
and the output was:
'sbatch: error: bank_limit plugin: expired user, can't submit job
 sbatch: error: Batch job submission failed: Invalid account or account/partition combination specified

would you mind help me figure out what is wrong with my account? thanks very much for your help, best regards,
Juan
