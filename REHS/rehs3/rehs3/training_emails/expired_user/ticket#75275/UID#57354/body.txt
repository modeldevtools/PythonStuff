[Ticket created from XUP by debolina]
[From: Debolina Dasgupta]
[System: Comet]
[Category: Batch Queues/Jobs]
I sometimes get the following error when I try submitting a job to large-shared:
sbatch: error: bank_limit plugin: not found user association debolina
sbatch: error: Batch job submission failed: Invalid account or account/partition combination specified

It takes multiple trials to submit a job.
