When I'm submitting sbatch commands to COMET I get the following error:

sbatch: error: bank_limit plugin: expired user, can't submit job
sbatch: error: Batch job submission failed: Invalid account or account/partition combination specified

Is my account inactive, or am I doing something else incorrectly?

Thanks!
