Hi,
I am getting an error (see below) while submitting an ABAQUS job 
"sbatch: error: bank_limit plugin: not found user association mithilam
sbatch: error: Batch job submission failed: Invalid account or account/partition combination specified"

Please help me solve this issue.

Thanks and Regards,
