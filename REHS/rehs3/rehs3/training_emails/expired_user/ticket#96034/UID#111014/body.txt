Hi,

When I try to send batch jobs today, this is the message that I am getting:

"sbatch: error: bank_limit plugin: expired user, can't submit job
sbatch: error: Batch job submission failed: Invalid account or account/partition combination specified"

Is that something that I did? or Is this because the previous grant expired and the new starts tomorrow?

Thank you.
