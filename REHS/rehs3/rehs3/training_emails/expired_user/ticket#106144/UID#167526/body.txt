[Ticket created from XUP by ffangliu]
[From: Fang Liu]
[System: Comet]
[Category: Batch Queues/Jobs]
Dear Help Desk, our research group has been granted the renewed resources on Comet, starting from 4/1. However, we have noticed that we can no longer submit jobs to the queue since last night.  We receive the following error messages when submitting CPU jobs on Comet:
sbatch: error: bank_limit plugin: expired user, can't submit job
sbatch: error: Batch job submission failed: Invalid account or account/partition combination specified

This not only happens to me (user id: fangliu) but also other users on this allocation.

Could you help with this issue?

Thanks,
Fang
