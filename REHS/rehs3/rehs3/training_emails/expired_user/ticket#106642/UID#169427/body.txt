Hello,

I am attempting to access one of the comet p100 GPUs through project sio134
(username - gmooers) in an attempt to run some machine learning code.
However, I am getting the following error message following the command
line prompt:

sbatch train_gpu.sb

batch: error: bank_limit plugin: expired user, can't submit job

sbatch: error: Batch job submission failed: Invalid account or
account/partition combination specified

I attached a screenshot of the .sb file I have been using to try to submit
this job to slurm. Any insight into the cause of this issue would be
greatly appreciated.

Thanks,
Griffin
