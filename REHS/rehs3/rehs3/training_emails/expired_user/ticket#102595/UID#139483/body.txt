Hi,

I get the following error when submitting

Sbatch: error: back_limit plugin: user is disallowed to submit jobs
Sbatch: error: Batch job submission failed: Invalid account or account/partition combination specified

I am using a job script on the comet website that was working a few weeks ago.

I would appreciate your help.
Thanks,
Amir
