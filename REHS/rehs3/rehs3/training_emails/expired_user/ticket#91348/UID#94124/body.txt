I could submit job normally last month. But starting from this month, when I use the same pbs file to submit job, I have the following error: 

There was an error running the SLURM sbatch command.
The command was:
'/usr/bin/sbatch run.pbs  2>&1'
and the output was:
'sbatch: error: bank_limit plugin: not found user association dcui
 sbatch: error: Batch job submission failed: Invalid account or account/partition combination specified
