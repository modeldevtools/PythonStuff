Dear colleague,

Our previous project has expired in March 31th 2018, and the new project (Charge #:TG-PHY130003, PI is Xia Hong) should work from today (April 1st). However, when I submitted a test calculation, I got these errors:

There was an error running the SLURM sbatch command.
The command was:
'/usr/bin/sbatch aiidasubmit.sh  2>&1'
and the output was:
'sbatch: error: bank_limit plugin: expired user, can't submit job
 sbatch: error: Batch job submission failed: Invalid account or account/partition combination specified
'

Do these errors mean that the new project hasn't started working?

Best wishes
Yuewen
