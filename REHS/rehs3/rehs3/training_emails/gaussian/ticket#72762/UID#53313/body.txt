I need to run some very demanding post-Hartree Fock ab initio calculations on some XSEDE system with Gaussian 09 or 16.  As you know, Gaussian's post-HF code does not parallelize very well.  At the same time, the longest wall time that seems to be available on a machine with Gaussian is 96 hours on Bridges.  Do you have any advice on how to pull off these calculations?  Thanks much for your help!
