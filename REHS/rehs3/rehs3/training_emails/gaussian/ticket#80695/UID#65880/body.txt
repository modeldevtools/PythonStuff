I am a new member of Comet under project number TG-CHE140012. I cannot find my home directory. Also I am having trouble using Gaussian I was told I needed to be added to the Gaussian group. Lastly, members of our project have been unable to submit jobs to Comet today. If you could help me with these three things that would be greatly appreciated.
