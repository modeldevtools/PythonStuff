Hi
we are using some software that prefers petsc 3.7.7 (the default module on comet is 3.6.3).
so we are trying to install 3.7.7 in home directory.

we successfully configured, compiled and installed petsc.
my configure log - /home/dstegman/petsc-3.7.7/configure.log 
but encountered a problem when it ran tests (see attached image). 
the error is related to limic2 which is a module for mvapich2. we read on one forum a thread from a previous user having a similar problem:
http://mailman.cse.ohio-state.edu/pipermail/mvapich-discuss/2011-June/003430.html

The installation instructions for LiMIC2 are located here:
http://hpc.wm.edu/software/docs/mvapich2-1.9-userguide.pdf

If LiMIC2 is properly installed, we should just be able to include --with-limic2 in the configure line. 

The LiMIC library path is /opt/mvapich2/intel/ib/lib
Additionally, there is a final called limic.h located in /opt/mvapich2/intel/ib/include
