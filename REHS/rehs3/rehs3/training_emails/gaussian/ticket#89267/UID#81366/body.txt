Hello, sorry to bother you.

I have some problems with adding to programs and running jobs. 

(1) running jobs. It seems that I do not have access to gaussian software. Can you add me to gaussian software so that I can do calculation using that?

(2) adding to programs. I have been moved to the program last December by someone. My PI and I are wondering whether I was moved by the co-PI, yusen or by allocation manager. Thanks for letting me know.

Sincerely,
Qiaomu
