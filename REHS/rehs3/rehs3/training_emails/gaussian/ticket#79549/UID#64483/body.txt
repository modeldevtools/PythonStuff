We are working on CHARMM General Force Field parameterization of small organic inhibitors for the SHP-2 active site with a view to performing molecular dynamics docking studies. The inhibitors come from two classes of competitive general phosphatase inhibitors, isothiazolidinone (IZD) phosphate mimetics and oxindole scaffolds. We use the VMD Force Field Tool Kit (ffTK) plugin to implement the CHARMM workflow. A key part of the CHARMM philosophy involves matching Quantum Chemistry calculations (using Gaussian 09) with Molecular Mechanics simulations to determine parameters. Currently, our workstation requires 3-4 weeks per candidate molecule to complete the quantum chemistry calculations.

We would like to evaluate the use of COMET with Gaussian. Assuming a positive outcome, we would apply for an allocation.
