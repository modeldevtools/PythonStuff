Dear XSEDE and SDSC Help Desks:

Recently, I received an educational allocation (TG-ENG180006) for my course CHME 461: Calculation of Material and Molecular Properties.

Students in this course will be using Gaussian 09 software. Is it feasible to have the following added to the Gaussian 09 user group on Comet? Each of these students has an account on comet.
