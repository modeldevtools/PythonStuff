Good afternoon,


I was intending to run a job using Gaussian16 (or Gaussian09) on Comet, but it appears I am denied access. I have loaded both the Gaussian and Gaussian16 modules, and attempted to find the executable using 'which g16', 'which g09',  and 'which gaussian'. All commands end up not finding the executable and any attempt to enter those directories are denied. The information provided by XSEDE and SDCC is not very clear regarding this issue, but I assume I must request access. My username is wizard.


Best regards,



Adam Kirkpatrick
