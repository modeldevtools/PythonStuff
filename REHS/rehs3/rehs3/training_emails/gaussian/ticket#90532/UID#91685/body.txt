Hello,

I was wondering if there are any sample scripts to access Gaussian 16 on the Comet cluster. I loaded the Gaussian module on my account, however, I cannot access the binary, g16. Our campus has a Gaussian license, in case, that is needed to access the software on Comet. 

I appreciate any assistance that you may be able to provide. 

Thanks,
Arun
