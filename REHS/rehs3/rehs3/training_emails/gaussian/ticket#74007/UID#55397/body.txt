To Whom It May Concern,

I have been using ifort and -mkl (to access LAPACK routines) for a while now to compile a serial program of mine, schematically as follows:
ifort module.f myprogram.f -mkl
I've had no problems then submitting the executable to the shared queue on a single processor, including earlier today.

This afternoon I received the error below which I don't know what to do with.  Please let me know if this is just a problem for me and what I can do to avoid this.  Thank you for your quick resolutions.

Thanks,
John Villanova
