Students using allocation TG-CHE160058 on comet are getting a similar error to last year about not being able to locate the Gaussian16 code.  Last year they needed to be added to the user group with permission to use the code,  Is that the same this year.  If so, please let me know what I should do to request permission for the group.

Thank you,

John Determan
