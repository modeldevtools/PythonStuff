Hi, 
Following the examples in /share/apps/examples, I am trying to run a gaussian job but I have been unsuccessful so far. My batch file is resp_SCH2CH3.sb and the error I am getting is mentioned in:  gauss.15335648.comet-23-42.out. The gaussian input file was created by Avogadro and is called Mol_red1.com. All files can be found in the following directory:
------------------------------------------------
[sturzo@comet-ln2 resp_cys]$ pwd
/home/sturzo/resp_cys
-----------------------------------------------
Please help me fix this issue

-Thanks
