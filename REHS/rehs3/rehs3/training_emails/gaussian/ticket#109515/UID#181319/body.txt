When a job is submitted it immediately fails, returning the following error message:

which: no g09 in (/opt/gaussian/09.D.01/g09:/opt/gnu/gcc/bin:/opt/gnu/bin:/opt/mvapich2/intel/ib/bin:/opt/intel/composer_xe_2013_sp1.2.144/bin/intel64:/opt/intel/composer_xe_2013_sp1.2.144/mpirt/bin/intel64:/opt/intel/composer_xe_2013_sp1.2.144/debugger/gdb/intel64_mic/bin:/usr/lib64/qt-3.3/bin:/usr/local/bin:/bin:/usr/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/opt/sdsc/bin:/opt/sdsc/sbin:/opt/ibutils/bin:/usr/java/latest/bin:/opt/pdsh/bin:/opt/rocks/bin:/opt/rocks/sbin:/home/rodrmich/bin)

I have attached the script I use to submit Gaussian jobs.

Let me know if you need anymore information.

Thank you.
