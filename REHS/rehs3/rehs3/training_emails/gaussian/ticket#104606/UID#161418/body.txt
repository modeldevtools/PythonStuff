Hi!

We have an allocation for xsede (mit136). I want to use gaussian09 on comet. I include the following in myself script:

module load gaussian/09.D.01
/opt/gaussian/09.D.01/g09 < scoE_small_opt.com > scoE_small_opt.log

But i get an error saying permission denied. Could you please guide me on how to use gaussian09 for my calculation?
