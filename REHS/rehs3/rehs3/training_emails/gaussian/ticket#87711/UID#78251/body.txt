Hello,

I was running calculations on comet using  gaussian/16.A.03. Today I found that the calculation crashed in the middle because there is no /opt/gaussian/16.A.03/g16/16 anymore.
Now, I am trying to use gaussian/16.B.01/, however it doesnâ€™t work because there is no available  module for it (only module for gaussian/16.A.03  is  available).
Could you please add module for gaussian/16.B.01 or return path /opt/gaussian/16.A.03/g16/16?

Thank you
Elena
