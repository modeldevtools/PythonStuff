The current version of Molden on Comet (molden/5.0.7) cannot open files relating to the newest version of Gaussian (gaussian/16.B.01). This makes work much more difficult and persuades users to continue to use the slower, outdated form of Gaussian (gaussian/09.D.01). The Molden5.7 source code has been updated to handle these output files and would make using Gaussian16 much easier. I was wondering if there is an plan to updated Molden, or if there was some way I could request this update?

Thank you,
Joe
