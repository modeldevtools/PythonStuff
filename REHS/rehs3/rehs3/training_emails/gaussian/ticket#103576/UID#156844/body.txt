Hello,
I am using COMET and I have been encountering an error. Every time I try to
submit more than one calculation at a time to gaussian09, the computation
will fail and I get the following error:

/usr/bin/time: cannot run g09: Too many levels of symbolic links
0.00user 0.00system 0:00.00elapsed 0%CPU (0avgtext+0avgdata 256maxresident)k
0inputs+8outputs (0major+52minor)pagefaults 0swaps

What might be causing this error?

Sincerely,
Robert T. Martin
