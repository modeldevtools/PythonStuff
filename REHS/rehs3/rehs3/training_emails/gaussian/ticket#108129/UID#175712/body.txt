To Whom It May Concern,

I tried to use Gaussian 09 and Gaussian 16 but got the following message: Permission Denied. I am a group member of Peng Liu's group at the University of Pittsburgh, Chemistry Department. Other group members can successfully use Gaussian 09 and Gaussian 16. I don't know why I can't.
