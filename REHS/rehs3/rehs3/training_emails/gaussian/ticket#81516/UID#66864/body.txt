[Ticket created from XUP by guest]
[From: Edward Acheampong]
[System: Comet]
[Category: Batch Queues/Jobs]
This is Dave Close.  I have a student Edward Acheampong who wants to run
Gaussian09 jobs on comet. Each time we try to run a job is quits in just a second or two.  No output file is generated.
  There are no diagnostics, so we cannot tell what is wrong.
  I generated a generic batch file (see in Edwards account as batch4.txt)
  Could the problem be that there is no link to my time allocation?
  Regards, Dave Close
