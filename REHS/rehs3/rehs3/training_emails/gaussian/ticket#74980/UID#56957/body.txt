Hello,

In project mcp101, we teach students to run gaussian simulation jobs. Could you add the following users to gaussian group so that they have permission to run gaussian on Comet? The students' accounts are listed:

stza36 (Stefan Alexandrescu)
dnguy282 (David Nguyen)
capio411 (khoa vuong)

Thank you very much!!
Please let me know if you need any other info.

Best,
Li
