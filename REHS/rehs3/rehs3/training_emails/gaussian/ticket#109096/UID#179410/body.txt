I am in need to run some Gaussian simulations on Comet. To test the manner of submitting jobs to Comet I copied the directory /share/apps/examples/GAUSSIAN/16_revB_cpu and I tried to run that job.  I keep on receiving the error shown below. Is there a new recommended approach to access the Gaussian executables? Thank you very much Ana

Error from the output file:
