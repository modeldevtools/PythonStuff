HI!

So, I probably am making a silly mistake, but I can't figure out what is wrong with my batch script. I tried to run a test Gaussian 16 optimization, and my slurm output file is complaining with the following:

which: no g16 in (/opt/gaussian/16.A.03/g16:/opt/gnu/gcc/bin:/opt/gnu/bin:/opt/mvapich2/intel/ib/bin:/opt/intel/composer_xe_2013_sp1.2.144/bin/intel64:/opt/intel/composer_xe_2013_sp1.2.144/mpirt/bin/intel64:/opt/intel/composer_xe_2013_sp1.2.144/debugger/gdb/intel64_mic/bin:/usr/lib64/qt-3.3/bin:/usr/local/bin:/bin:/usr/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/opt/ibutils/bin:/usr/java/latest/bin:/opt/pdsh/bin:/opt/rocks/bin:/opt/rocks/sbin:/opt/sdsc/bin:/opt/sdsc/sbin:/home/livia/bin)

Attached the script and the slurm out.

Thanks!
