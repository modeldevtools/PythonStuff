Dear XSEDE Help,
        I am having issues with gaussian calculations on comet nodes where a calculation will fail due to not having enough available memory. Currently, I request 50GB of memory using the following line:

#SBATCH --mem=50GB

while in my gaussian input file I tell it that it has only 40gb of memory (I know gaussian tends to use more memory than you give it, so I always create a buffer). Am I requesting the memory incorrectly, or is there a different issue?
Thanks,
      Tal Aharon
