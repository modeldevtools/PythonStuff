    I ran the same Gaussian09 job on Comet with three slightly different input files. All three crashed without giving any error in the Gaussian09 output files.
  I have attached the three input files and the corresponding gausscompute...out files. Also an example of the batch script.

For the gausscompute...out files:
...04-36.out corresponds to a
...04-42.out corresponds to b
...01-18.out corresponds to c

  Please help me figure out what's wrong!
  Thanks,
  Ted
