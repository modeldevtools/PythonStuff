Hi,

We are trying to calculate a large molecule (242 atoms, 2172 basis) using Gaussian on Comet. The structure optimization proceeded well, however the frequency calculation did not finish and that without hitting the wall time. I suspect this may be caused by a lack of memory. 
It worths mentioning that I ran the frequency calculation twice and it stopped both time at the same step, most importantly, the log files don't mention errors from Gaussian, which makes me think the jobs hit a limit on Comet. If of any help, the first job number was 11759457 and the second 11797105.
We are running our calculations on 16 processors with 54GB of memory (which I believe is the max allowed for our allocation). I wondered is there is a chance to run this job with more memory allowed and maybe with a longer wall time/more processors?

Best,
Thibault Cheisson
