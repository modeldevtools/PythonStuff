Ticket submitted on behalf of PI - assigned to SDSC.  Chris Hempel


Since I'm new to XSEDE, if you have any documents that guide us on
How to access comet SDSC
How to load Gaussian 09/16 module
How to submit a job in a queue
What are the other ways of submitting a gaussian job
that will be really valuable

Again, thank you for your kind considerations,
Sincerely,
Ruchira
