I am attempting to run a MP2/aug-cc-pvtz calculation on Gaussian16 on Comet's large-shared queue.  I have tried a couple of things that work on my local machines but cannot work on comet.  

The Gaussian output file simply terminates.  And the "queue" output file gauss.15401568.comet-30-01.out  gives: 

41931.72user 484.62system 30:00.29elapsed 2356%CPU (0avgtext+0avgdata 125828664maxresident)k

slurmstepd: Exceeded step memory limit at some point.
slurmstepd: Exceeded job memory limit at some point.

Again, I have tried a couple of things but am just burning SUs.  Would you please point me in the write direction. 

files are located at /home/dlawson/gaussian/CO2-water/MP2-apvtz

Thank you,
