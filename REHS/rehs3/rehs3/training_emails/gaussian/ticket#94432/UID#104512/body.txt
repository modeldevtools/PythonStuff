When running computations today, it appears that Matthew Ward has not been given permission to use Gaussian16 software.  (He had permission on the TG-CHE160058 time allotment, but does not seem to have it on the TG-CHE170008 time account.)  I also want to make sure that a couple others that have been switch from TG-CHE160058 to TG-CHE170008, Ana Bjelica and Mary Bjelica will also be added to the Gaussian16 user group on this account.

Please let me know if any additional information may be needed.

Thank you,

John Determan
