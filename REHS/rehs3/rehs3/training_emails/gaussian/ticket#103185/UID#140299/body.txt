Hi,
      I have some code on Comet which must submit large numbers of gaussian calculations. Many of my calculations end immediately because they cannot find g09. My best guess is that the calculations are being assigned to nodes which do not have gaussian installed. How do I ensure that this does not happen? I have attached an output file from one of these failed calculations.
Thanks,
      Tal Aharon
