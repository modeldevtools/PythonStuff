Hi,

I am aware that the Gaussian 09 software package is installed and available on Comet, while the most recent version of the software (Gaussian 16), doesn't seem available.

I simply wanted to ask: can I expect Gaussian 16 to be available on Comet in the near future, or should I look elsewhere for now? Is there a proper channel through which I could request such new softwares to be purchased and installed on Comet?

Thank you very much,

Pier Alexandre Champagne
