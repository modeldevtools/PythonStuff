Hi,

I have recently added my students to my educational account.  While in class yesterday I had them load the Gaussian module in the general environment and it seemed to work.  However, when they go to run a job with a batch script (the same one currently running a job for me) they get a 'permission denied' error.  Can you enable permissions for the following usernames to use Gaussian: coleh19, kkrs821, nshann, pzayka, jrolleri

Thanks,
Nicole
