I recently received time on comet for a course I am teaching.  I had the students create accounts on xsede and added them to the account today (tam112).  I want to make sure my students are added to the gaussian group so they may run the software. Also, is there some way I can see there stuff or provide them access to scripts and files?  Is there a project or class directory that is available? 

Here are my students xsede account usernames:
1.	Erick Vazquez Cano (erickvzq)
2.	ramon trevino (rayz97)
3.	Fernand Medrano (fer13)
4.	Juan Ramirez (e1juan)
5.	Trinidad Garza (trini18)
6.  	Jorge Pina (mono6621)
7.	Gerardo Guardiola (gg19)
8.	Nicolette Valdez (nickyval)
9.	Luis Montalvo (lmon15)
10.	Crystal Ramirez (crysram)
