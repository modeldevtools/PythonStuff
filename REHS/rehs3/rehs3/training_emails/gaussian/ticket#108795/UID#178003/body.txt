Hello,
One of my students noted the following error when compiling with ifort:
ifort: error #10001: could not find directory in which g++ resides

I got the same result when I tried ifort.
We both have the command: module load intel  mvapich2_ib in our .bashrc, which still seems to be what is recommended.

I trust you will be able resolve this problem.

Thanks,
--Pat
