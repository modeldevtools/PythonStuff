Hello,

I have been submitting Gaussian09 calculations using a script called comet.py. I usually will receive a .log file in either my completed calculations or my home directory. Recently some of my calculations have not returned a .log file in either my home directory or my completed calculations directory. I do receive a .out file with a list of errors that says the following:

 Read checkpoint file Epoxy-tdb-complex-Ni-L-OA-1-4-b-2-rad-inner-top-abcd-MigInst-TS.chk
 Write formatted file Epoxy-tdb-complex-Ni-L-OA-1-4-b-2-rad-inner-top-abcd-MigInst-TS.fchk
 Missing data for FChkPn.

One of the files I have been trying to submit using comet.py is called : 

Epoxy-tdb-complex-Ni-L-OA-1-4-b-2-rad-inner-top-abcd-MigInst-TS.com 

and it returns the file:

Epoxy-tdb-complex-Ni-L-OA-1-4-b-2-rad-inner-top-abcd-MigInst-TS.out 

which states the above error. I do not have a .log file from my calculation. 

What could be the reason for my calculation to run but not return a .log file? Is it due to the way my comet.py file is written?

I have attached my comet.py file
