Hello,

I (user jstevens on comet) have, I think,  just added 3 users (smithzr3, nikkio, alice1) as users of grant TG-CHE180078 on comet.

I would like these users to have permission for gaussian 09 and gaussian 16 programs.

Do you have any sample job queue submission scripts for gaussian 16 on comet?

Many thanks

J Stevens (PI of TG-CHE180078 on comet)
