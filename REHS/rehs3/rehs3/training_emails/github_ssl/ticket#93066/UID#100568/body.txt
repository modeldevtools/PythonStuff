I have been unable to clone Git repositories over https. The resulting output gives an SSl error:

[ramasubv@comet-ln3 local]$ git clone https://github.com/eigenteam/eigen-git-mirror.git
Cloning into 'eigen-git-mirror'...
fatal: unable to access 'https://github.com/eigenteam/eigen-git-mirror.git/': SSL connect error

The same commands work fine on my local machine, so it may be an issue with the openssl or curl libraries on Comet.
