Hi,

Having issue trying to get anything from git. When using ssl I get this error:

git clone https://github.com/ameenetemady/GNN.git
fatal: unable to access 'https://github.com/ameenetemady/GNN.git/': SSL connect error

Can you please help?
I tried ssh(instead of https), it also didn't work

Thanks,
Ameen.
