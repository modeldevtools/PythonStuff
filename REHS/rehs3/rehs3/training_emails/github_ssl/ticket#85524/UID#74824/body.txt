Hello, 

I encountered an error when I attempted to use "git pull" to update my code from the Github repository and got the following message:
fatal: unable to access 'https://github.com/liubinxu/HPC_Job.git/': SSL connect error

It would be very helpful if you can have a look into this problem. Thanks in advance!

Best,
Liubin
