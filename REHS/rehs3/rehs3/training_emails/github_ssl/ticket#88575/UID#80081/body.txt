Dear Sir/Madam,

I tried to install one code (pySCF) on Comet. However I have a problem when compiling the code.
Below is the error:

[  1%] Performing download step (git clone) for 'libxcfun'
Cloning into 'libxcfun'...
fatal: unable to access 'https://github.com/dftlibs/xcfun.git/': SSL connect error
Cloning into 'libxcfun'...

-- Had to git clone more than once:
          3 times.
CMake Error at /home/chp071/Codes/pyscf/pyscf/lib/build/deps/tmp/libxcfun-gitclone.cmake:66 (message):
  Failed to clone repository: 'https://github.com/dftlibs/xcfun.git'


make[2]: *** [deps/src/libxcfun-stamp/libxcfun-download] Error 1
make[1]: *** [CMakeFiles/libxcfun.dir/all] Error 2
make: *** [all] Error 2


Basically the code I compile need to download other package using "git clone" and it is not working.
Could you please help me to solve this problem?

Thank you,
Huy
