Good afternoon,


We are COMET users. We are trying to import some programs on comet

using the git clone command. However, we encounter this issue


git clone https://github.com/sunqm/pyscf

Cloning into 'pyscf'...

fatal: unable to access 'https://github.com/sunqm/pyscf/': SSL connect error


Can you please help us using git on COMET?

We already tried this command

git config --global http.sslVerify false

and editing the .gitconfig file as follows,

[http]

        sslVerify = false

without success


Thanks,

Mario and Yang
