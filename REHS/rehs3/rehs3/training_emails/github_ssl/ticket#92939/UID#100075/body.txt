Good evening,

I just logged onto to Comet to update a number of software packages I had previously installed. In most cases, these packages were cloned from github repositories.

This time, when I attempted to clone one of the repositories I received the following error:
fatal: unable to access 'https://github.com/dealii/candi.git/': SSL connect error

For reference, the command was:
git clone https://github.com/dealii/candi.git/


This error repeated when I tried to clone different repositories.

Any suggestions? A quick search suggested this may be a TSL issue: https://githubengineering.com/crypto-removal-notice/

Thanks in advance for the help!

Cheers,
John
