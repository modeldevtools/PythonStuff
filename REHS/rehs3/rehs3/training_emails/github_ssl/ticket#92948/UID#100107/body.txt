To whom it may concern,

I've been a COMET user for 1 year but I never tried to install my own software on COMET. Recently I need to install the MPI-AMRVAC for simulations following the instruction (http://amrvac.org/md_doc_installation.html). The installation is very easy on my own iMac. However, on COMET when I type 

git clone https://github.com/amrvac/amrvac.git

I received

fatal: unable to access 'https://github.com/amrvac/amrvac.git/': SSL connect error

I wonder is there a solution to this?


Thank you!
