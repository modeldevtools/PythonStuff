I'm trying to download the source for the PIO library so I can build it, using these commands:

      git clone https://github.com/NCAR/ParallelIO
      git clone https://github.com/NCAR/ParallelIO.git

but they both give me the same message

      fatal: unable to access 'http://github.com/NCAR/ParallelIO/': SSL connect error
      fatal: unable to access 'https://github.com/NCAR/ParallelIO.git/': SSL connect error

Is your filrewall blocking this?
I've added an RSA-certificate for cponder@comet-ln2.sdsc.edu so I don't think this is the issue.
I'd like to be able to download this kind of stuff directly, I won't need to upload anything.
