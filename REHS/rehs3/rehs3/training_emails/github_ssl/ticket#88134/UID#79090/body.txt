Hello,

I’m trying to clone a git repo on to Comet and am getting the following error:

$ git clone ambermd:amber.git amber2.git
Cloning into 'amber2.git'...
Enter passphrase for key '/home/tluchko/.ssh/id_amber_rsa': 
X11 forwarding request failed on channel 0
remote: Counting objects: 476274, done.
remote: Compressing objects: 100% (114272/114272), done.
buffer_append_space: alloc 67141632 not supportediB | 26.22 MiB/s   
fatal: The remote end hung up unexpectedly
fatal: early EOF
fatal: index-pack failed

I have successfully clone the Amber repository on to this machine before without problem and I not aware of anything changing.  I tried googling the error message but only came up with bugs that should have been fixed many years ago.

I’m trying to work around the problem by copying, not cloning,  a repository from another machine but this is taking awhile.

Please let me know if there is something that can be done to fix this.

Thank you,

Tyler
