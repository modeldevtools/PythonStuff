Hello,

Iâ€™m having trouble cloning a git repository on Comet.  When I run the command I get the following

comet-ln2:~>git clone gitosis@git.ambermd.org:amber.git
Cloning into 'amber'...
Warning: untrusted X11 forwarding setup failed: xauth key data not generated
Warning: No xauth data; using fake authentication data for X11 forwarding.
X11 forwarding request failed on channel 0
remote: Counting objects: 464631, done.
remote: Compressing objects: 100% (115273/115273), done.
buffer_append_space: alloc 67141632 not supportediB | 23.59 MiB/s   
fatal: The remote end hung up unexpectedly
fatal: early EOF
fatal: index-pack failed


I am able to run this command on other machines, including stampede2.  Any ideas what is wrong?

(I am aware that Amber is installed on Comet. I am a developer and will be testing my software on Comet.)

Thank you,

Tyler
