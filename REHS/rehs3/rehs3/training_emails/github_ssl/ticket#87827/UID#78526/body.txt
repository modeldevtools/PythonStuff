I'm trying to clone a repo via Git on Comet, using, e.g.:

git clone https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap.git

However, I keep getting the message:

fatal: unable to access 'https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap.git/': SSL
connect error

I have verified that the command works on my local machine.

What should I do?

Best regards,
Richard Barnes
