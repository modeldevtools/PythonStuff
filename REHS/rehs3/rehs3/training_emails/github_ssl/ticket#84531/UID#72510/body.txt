To whom it may concern,

I am curious to why I am receiving the following error when attempting to
update my previously accessible git repository on Comet.
fatal: unable to access 'https://github.com/skk74/CASMcode-dev.git/': SSL
connect error

It seems as though the SSL connection error indicates github is no longer
secure because it has a self signed certificate? Is this true or is
something else wrong. Have other users reported an issue with using codes
hosted on github?

Thanks,
