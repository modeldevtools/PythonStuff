Hi -


I'm seeing the following error when trying to clone a github repository.


[millsb@comet-ln2 ~]$ git clone https://github.com/bryanmills/hpc-course-2017.git hpc-course-2017-2
Cloning into 'hpc-course-2017-2'...
fatal: unable to access 'https://github.com/bryanmills/hpc-course-2017.git/': SSL connect error


I'm guessing something is blocking this access since this appears to work from other machines? Is there a proxy configuration we need to update? Public key missing?


Thanks.
