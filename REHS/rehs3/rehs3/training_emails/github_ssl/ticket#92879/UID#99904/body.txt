Hello, 

I’m working on Comet using some code I pulled via git. Due to Comet's ssh limitations I had pulled to the login node, then gsiscp'ed to Comet.

Now I’d like to commit my code changes. Surprisingly, I found the git program on Comet. « git commit » worked fine, but then :
[cpahl@comet-ln2 epidermis-scRNA-fork]$ git push
fatal: unable to access 'https://github.com/PHCC/epidermis-scRNA-1.git/': SSL connect error 

- that is a bit what I expected. But as git exists on Comet: Is there a faster way to push than copying to, then running git on the login node?

Thank you,
Christoph
