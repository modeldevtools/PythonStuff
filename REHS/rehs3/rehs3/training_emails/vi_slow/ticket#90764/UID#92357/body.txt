Hi,

I just wanted to report that I'm having issues with the Comet Scratch 
file system hanging with simple commands like ls, less, and cd.   Some 
commands are taking several minutes to resolve themselves.   Closing a 
hung terminal and reconnecting helps, but only temporarily.

Sincerely,
Elizabeth
