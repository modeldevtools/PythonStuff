Hi,

I have been editing scripts remotely via SSH and vim keeps freezing while I am in the middle of editing.

It seems to freeze during the day (when many users are probably also using COMET). Is it possible it is freezing because of high computing load during the day? Is there a way to prevent this?

Thanks

Jon
