Dear XSEDE help desk,

I am having issues with writing files to the scratch directory (/oasis/scratch/comet/$USER/temp_project/); namely, the actual writing of files takes a very long time compared to writing files to my home directory. I've tested this with empty text files as well as larger data files and write times are significantly longer than writing elsewhere. Is this a bug?


Thank you,
Kevin Chau
