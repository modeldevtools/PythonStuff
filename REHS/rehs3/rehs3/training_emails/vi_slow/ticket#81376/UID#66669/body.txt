To whom it may concern,
      As of now, the scratch directory on Comet is not responding normally.
      If I use "vi" to edit a simple text file and try to save the file, 
the directory does not respond. When I try to copy the file to the login 
node, it does not respond either.
      Thank you very much.
      Best regards.
