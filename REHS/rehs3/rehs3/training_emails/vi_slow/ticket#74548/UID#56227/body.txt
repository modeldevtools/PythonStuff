Hello,

I have recently been experiencing significant lag on Comet login nodes when performing mundane tasks. Things such as ‘ls’ or performing standard text editing with ‘vi’ are freezing for multiple seconds at a time before returning active. I have experienced this on two different networks, both with stable/fast connections.

I am still able to complete work, but it is a frustration, especially when trying to edit text files and encountering multiple second freezes on a regular basis.

Best regards,
Nathan
