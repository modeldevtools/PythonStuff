Hi, 

I've been doing some scaling tests on Comet using NWChem with 8, 12, 24, 48, and 96 processors. The compute time make sense for all the number of processor except 24 (single node), where it substantially slows down (figure attached). I'm wondering if there is any reason for this slow down and how can I avoid it. Thanks for your help.
