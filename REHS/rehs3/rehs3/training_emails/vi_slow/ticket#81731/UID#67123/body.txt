Hello,

I have a job (job id 13808757, nodelist comet-14-[09-45,48-58], submitted from /home/afraser/gene/prob03/ using the submit.cmd submit script in that directory) that has stalled since last night. Would it be possible to check if one of the nodes is faulty, or maybe the scratch directory is overloaded?

Thanks,
Adrian
