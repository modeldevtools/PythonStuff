Dear Administrator:

I have been experiencing issues with modifying files and saving them on
Comet scratch. It took me hours to modify a single file and save it using
vim; the interface freezes after writing a few letters or saving. Your help
is much appreciated.

Thank you.

Respectfully,

-Hassan
