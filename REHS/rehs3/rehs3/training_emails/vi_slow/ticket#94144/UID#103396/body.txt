Hello,

I am running NAMD jobs on the Comet cpu resource and the jobs are running remarkably slow. NAMD reports the following (average s/step is similar throughout the simulation):

TIMING: 595000  CPU: 889.034, 0.00468929/step  Wall: 944.754, 0.00499939/step, 34.4666 hours remaining, 2215.917969 MB of memory in use.

After almost 24 hours the timing is only at 595000 despite NAMD reporting ~0.005/step average during the run. The reported s/step is typical for a system of the size being run using the number of cores I am using. The total number of steps for 24 hours of simulation time is, however, quite strange. Might there have been a issue with one of the nodes that caused this apparent slow down/stall? I am assuming the simulation stalled since NAMD was reporting a fairly quick simulation.

Thanks,
Rory
