To whom this concerns,

       We have had some problems with nodes on Comet slowing down.  We are running a compiled version of CHARMM (c40b1), which was self-installed at  "/oasis/projects/nsf/uic317/zsx988/c40b1‚Äù, and the QCHEM environment in comet for QM/MM MD simulations. Normally our simulations run within 13 hours for 100 time steps, but on specific nodes we are encountering problems, where the jobs could not be finished over 48 hours. We have encountered slow down on some notes on comet-08-* and 10-47, 06-17, 06-55. It seems like the comet-08-* machine are more likely to have this kind of issue, while encountering slow down on other nodes are seldom. Which reason do you think caused the problem? Can you help us to solve the problem?

Thank you for your time and help,

David Stevens and Pengfei Li
