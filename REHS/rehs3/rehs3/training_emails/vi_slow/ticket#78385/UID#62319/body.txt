Hi

My Jobid 12396460 is pending for more than past 24 hours.
Although, I am requesting only 6 nodes for 15 minutes even its peding for so long.

The script which I used to submit this job is 
/oasis/scratch/comet/hjoshi/temp_project/popc/run-6.sh 

The job submission directory is 
/oasis/scratch/comet/hjoshi/temp_project/popc/

Kindly let me know how to reduce the waiting time.

Thank you.
Sincerely
Himanshu
