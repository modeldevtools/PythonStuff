I have noticed that my job 12195901 got stuck on Comet for almost 2 days. I was wondering if there is any issue with the nodes it landed. I noticed that similar thing happened with similar job submitted previously (Job Id 12139852). I also observed the place it got stuck was during Orthogonalization procedure which was performed on around 3000 vectors each of length 17M.

I am wondering if you have any pointers as to what is happening.
