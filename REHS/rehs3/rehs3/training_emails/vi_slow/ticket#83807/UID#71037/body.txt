Dear support,

I recently started to work on Comet. My simulations create larger output files, therefore, I am running them not in my home directory, but instead on oasis ( /oasis/scratch/comet/ojansen/temp_project/ ). However, I run into odd problems. My code, that runs stable on TACC clusters causes suddenly segmentation faults on Comet. I thought, this might be an issue of the code or dependencies, but also VI and VIM freeze whenever I try to edit my input files on Oasis. I can perfectly well edit files in my home directory. It seems, there is something wrong with my account or Oasis. Do you have an idea, what might cause the problem?
Sincerely,
 Oliver Jansen
