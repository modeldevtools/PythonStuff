Hi,

My name is Thanh. I'm using Comet cluster and it is very slow. About every
couple minutes, it takes several minutes for the sever to respond to any
actions that I'm doing, like editing a file, etc. It is thus very slow and
annoying to work on Comet cluster.
Do you know what might be the problem for that?
My ID is tcphan.

Best,

Thanh
