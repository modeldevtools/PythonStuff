Hi,

I'm observing unexpectedly slow run-time for some of my gpu jobs, running
on Comet.  An example can be found in the following directory:

/home/jshee/Mn3hexaqua/cc-pvtz-dk/deprot/CAStrial/runQMC/r2

The intermediates that are output by the program (in out.log) are all
numerically accurate, and nothing is crashing...however the calculation is
just taking an unreasonably long time so I've cancelled it.

A calculation of similar complexity, which ran in a reasonable amount of
time, can be found in this directory:
/home/jshee/Mn3hexaqua/cc-pvtz-dk/prot/CAS_trial/runQMC

I'm wondering if you could help me diagnose what might be going on here...
I thought perhaps I did not allocate enough memory, but even when I use the
(non-shared) gpu queue, requesting 120 GB of memory on the node, the
performance is still unexpectedly slow.

Any ideas would be greatly appreciated!
thanks, James
