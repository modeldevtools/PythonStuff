Dear XSEDE,


This call for help pertains to COMET.


I have noticed that when users are running programs interactively, that take up 100% of CPU usage (see a screenshot below), my 'vi' editor hangs almost infinitely. That is not the case with another editor, say 'nano'. I was wondering if there is a fix, to perhaps reserve some extra memory to vi (through ~/.vimrc) to facilitate that. For the time being, I cannot use vi in comet when some user has been running something for a long time (notice the times below) and I have to resort to creating my scripts locally, which I later transfer over - it's not too much, but certainly creating job scripts on comet might be better, as it takes lots of time to debug little bash scripts remotely. Interestingly, 'nano' doesn't show much deceleration, even though my shell freezes for up to 30 seconds under such conditions.


I'll appreciate any comments/fixes.


Thanks,

Amnaya
