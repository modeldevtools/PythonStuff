Hi,

I've been running a code for the last two weeks. The code started with a speed of

INFO (Carpet): Physical time per hour: 1.83945

but recently  the speed has dropped by around 60%. The current speed is
 
INFO (Carpet): Physical time per hour: 0.376285

This is the same code and same simulation. So, I'm puzzled.  I've recompiled the code 
but still I've the same  problem.  I'm wondering if I can do something to improve this behavior.  

I'd appreciate your help.

My running folder is:
/oasis/scratch/comet/ruizm/temp_project/regrid_48nodes_low

Thanks,

Milton
