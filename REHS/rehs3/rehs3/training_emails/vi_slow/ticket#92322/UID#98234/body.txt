Dear Sir/Madam,


My username on comet is abhattar and I have a job running right now named :


JOBID PARTITION     NAME     USER ST       TIME  NODES NODELIST(REASON)
          18065453   compute     edpo abhattar  R   23:01:45     25 comet-18-[06-07,09-10,12-13,19,34,46-47,55,65],comet-20-56,comet-23-[42-44,46,55,57,60,66-68,71-72]


But it seems to be running too slow as it expects to finish the job within 486 hrs, which I could finish in 48 hrs previously with same number of processors. I would be glad if you could have a look.


Thanks,


Best Regards,

Apurba
