[Ticket created from XUP by svprice]
[From: Stephen Price]
[System: Comet]
[Category: Login Hub]
Working on Comet last week was fine. The login node was slow, but bearably slow.

This week, on the other hand, has been very very tough working with Comet. Moving a simple, small directory took 35 minutes. A single ls can take several minutes, and working in Vim is completely off limits.

I've attempted to login to the other login nodes, and even just login and logout repeatedly, but this yields almost no benefit.

Is there any way to reduce the latency with the login nodes? I'm starting to find the problem almost intractable.

Any help is greatly appreciated.

Thank you so much,
Stephen
