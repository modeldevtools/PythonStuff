Hi Marty Kandes,


Sorry I didn't get the email from you last time since I was not on the receiver list but my advisor.

I've put the GIBBON in my home directory tried to use the installation file to instal Gibbon.

I follow the instruction of this (http://www.sdsc.edu/support/user_guides/tutorials/matlab.html)

and use "Interactive job with non-GUI option".

Now I can execute the hello.m on Comet, but when I try to execute the installGibbon.m, it just stuck there.

Is there anything worng there or should I use GUI option?

I also tried to use GUI option, and open 2 terminal windows, but it just stuck there like this until time out,

Please help and let me know how to install Gibbon on comet, thanks.
