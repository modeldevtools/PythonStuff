Hello,

I have been experiencing extremely long latencies when issuing commands on
Oasis over an ssh connection. Colleagues of mine have reported the same
experience on various network connections. Commands as simple as ls hang
for minutes at a time (it took me 10 minutes to push a single file to git
yesterday). I'm currently working on Comet/Oasis without these issues,
which is great, but I have no idea what causes them to start as it seems
totally independent of my activity on XSEDE resources.

Thanks for your time,
Dylan Uys
