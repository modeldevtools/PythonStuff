Hi,

I am trying run my jobs on comet unfortunately the network is very low.
What I actually mean is for each and every step I have to wait for minimum 3 minutes.
For example,
1. If I open the sbatch script, submit.sb, it will take a minute to open and if I make any changes inside the script it will take another minute to implement the changes and another couple of minutes to close the file.
2. After submitting the job it will take another 3 minutes for squeue.
3. For 10 minutes test run I have to wait for at least 1 hour if it is a single job if multiple jobs then it will be in a queue for few hours. This is just for 10 minutes test jobs!
4. Yesterday, my 48 hours job waited in a queue for 24 hours just to throw a following error message,
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
orterun was unable to launch the specified application as it could not
change to the specified working directory:

Working directory: /home/sjohn07/scratch/b-amylase/anton2BW
Node: comet-29-30

while attempting to start process rank 544.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
16 total processes failed to start

I am really frustrated with the current process. Could you please tell me is there any better way to work on comet?

This is how I login to comet: ssh sjohn07@comet.sdsc.xsede.org

Thanks,
Shalini
