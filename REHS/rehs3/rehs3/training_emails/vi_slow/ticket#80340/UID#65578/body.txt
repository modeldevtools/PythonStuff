Dear All:

Accessing files to edit them on the scratch space on comet is very slow 
for me. After opening the file using emacs or vi, and making changes, it 
takes ~1 minute for the file to be saved.Â  I have had this problem for a 
long time now. Is this related to my account only or is this a general 
problem? Is there any fix?

Thank you!

Wissam
