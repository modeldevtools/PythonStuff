One of my jobs aborted again due to 
wrf.exe: posixio.c:237: px_pgout: Assertion `*posp == ((off_t)(-1)) || *posp == lseek(nciop->fd, 0, 1)' failed

See details in 
/oasis/scratch/comet/xhu2/temp_project/Run/2016ACT-America/WRFV3.9.1/wrfchem3.9.1_NCEP_DOE1d_CONUS_NEI2011_MEGAN_Snudge_add_chemdiag.2016072400/rsl.error.0000

Last time when I had this issue, I moved some stuff from scratch to /oasis/projects/nsf/uok114/xhu2  to solve the problem

Do I have to do this again? 
But according to 
lfs quota -u $USER /oasis/scratch/comet
I only used 19T of total 31T.

The aborted job is beneath /oasis/scratch/comet/xhu2/temp_project/Run/2016ACT-America/WRFV3.9.1/wrfchem3.9.1_NCEP_DOE1d_CONUS_NEI2011_MEGAN_Snudge_add_chemdiag.2016072400
The submission script is wrf_2400.sh under the directory
Any idea?
