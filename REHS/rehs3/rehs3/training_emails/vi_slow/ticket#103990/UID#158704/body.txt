Hi,

I am having trouble with using Vim to edit files (both on job submission node and login node) on Comet. Whenever I move around the text with arrow key for too long or whenever I write a file, the editor always freezes up. This has occurred to the point that editing files on the server has become impossible. Please let me know if there is a way I can solve this.
