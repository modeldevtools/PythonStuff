Hello,

Lately my simulations on Comet have been taking significantly longer to compute each timestep despite no changes to the simulations themselves. In the past, this has been correlated with instances of the /oasis/scratch/comet filesystem being somehow overloaded -- perhaps it becomes more time-consuming for simulations to save data to disk, so the simulations run slower even though the CPUs are able to compute at their usual speeds. Have there been any reports of the scratch directory being overloaded recently? I'm experiencing these issues with a simulations that's currently running, as well as a couple others I've run in the last 2-3 days.

Thanks,
Adrian
