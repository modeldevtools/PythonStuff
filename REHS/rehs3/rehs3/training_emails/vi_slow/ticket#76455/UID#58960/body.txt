When I try to use ls to see inside my /oasis/scratch/comet directory, the terminal hangs for about a minute. I can change into various directories just fine, but editing or even listing files takes an extremely long time. Even tab completion takes a very long time.

Editing files (both in /oasis/scratch/comet and in my home directory) has always been very laggy, but never this bad.

There are a couple resource-intensive processes running on the login node, but they don't seem to be using all the cores or memory.
