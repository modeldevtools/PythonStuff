I continually have issues submitting jobs to Comet. My 4 node job has been
stuck in the queue for quite some time.

It looks like 2 users have submitted a total of 6500 jobs out of the total
7500 in the queue.
I guess this is the peak hours, but it still seems a little ridiculous.

Is this the reason the scheduler takes so long to reserve 4 nodes for me?

Thank you,
James
