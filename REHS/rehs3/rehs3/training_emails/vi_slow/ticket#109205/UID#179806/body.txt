Hello, 

When I log on to COMET everything is running very slowly, even just listing files in a directory. When I run htop I can see that there is a lot of swapping going on ~6494/8183MB. Could you please take a look and see if you can figure out what is doing all this swapping?

Thank you,
Catherine

P.S. I'm not really sure if this is related but it looks like a user named "casmith" is trying to compile gromacs. Those jobs keep running and then disappearing so I don't know what they're doing but could this be having any impact on the speed of the machine?
