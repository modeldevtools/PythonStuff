Hi, 
sometimes some of my job are very slow, likely because of the presence of zombies on
some nodes, e.g., now this jobs is unsually slow:
 19965227   compute wmed_sst lrenault  R    2:00:02     13 comet-19-[01,03-06,08-14,16]

I would appreciate if you could do something to fix it ..
thanks
best
Lionel
