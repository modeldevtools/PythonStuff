Hi,

I'm using comet and the head node is quite slow.
- Login often take several seconds to a minute to complete.
- Simple commands like 'ls' sometimes takes several seconds to execute.
- I'm trying to compile my software and usually it takes 10-20s but it's
taking several minutes to compile it.
- It's also very slow when I save a modified file using vim (often take
5-10 seconds), opening and editing files is normal.

My username is tcphan and project name is ios115.
The software that I'm compiling is in the folder:
/oasis/projects/nsf/ios115/tcphan/CAC/CAC_V2/V2.3.01/src/

Can you please take a look? It's quite inconvenient to work on a slow head
node.

Best,

Thanh
