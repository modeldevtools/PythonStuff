Hi,

For the last couple of days I've being trying to put simulation to run on comet. However, the process of editing the scripts on comet and even doing "ls" takes a while. About two days ago I have a lot difficulties opening scripts with emacs and gedit. Please let me know if I can receive any help with these, because is slowing a lot my submission process. 

Thanks,

Liza
