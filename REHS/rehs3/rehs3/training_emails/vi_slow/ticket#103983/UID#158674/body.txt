Dear help team,

My workflow involves copying the dataset to the local SSD scratch place 
before start training model on the dataset to enhance throughput. 
However, I found that copying the same dataset takes different amount of 
time. I'm worrying whether it implies something went wrong. The log is 
shown here, where every two lines is one log file:

```
[23:39:20] kkew@comet-ln3:.. sfm$ cat *{21515599,21515718,21515768}.out
Tue Feb 19 07:15:40 UTC 2019 -- copying dataset to scratch place
Tue Feb 19 07:20:45 UTC 2019 -- completed copying dataset to scratch place
Tue Feb 19 07:30:17 UTC 2019 -- copying dataset to scratch place
Tue Feb 19 07:31:45 UTC 2019 -- completed copying dataset to scratch place
Tue Feb 19 07:35:02 UTC 2019 -- copying dataset to scratch place
Tue Feb 19 07:36:30 UTC 2019 -- completed copying dataset to scratch place
```

The first SLURM out shows that copying takes 5 minutes whereas the next 
two takes one minute each.

Thank you so much for your suggestions.
