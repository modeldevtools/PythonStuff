Hello,

I have a large simulation running on Comet that is going slower than I expect, i.e., there hasn't been a timestep for the last hour and a half or so. In the past this has happened when either the scratch filesystem is overloaded or one of the nodes isn't running well. Would it be possible to look into this? The job id is 13761277, and the nodelist is comet-18-[01-15,17-22,24-34,36-51].

Thanks,
Adrian
