Job ID 10702220 is running but not writing the output files. Log file looks good to me. 

Also, I am not able to connect to these folders through Globus:

/oasis/scratch-comet/vhasti/temp_project/vbb
/oasis/scratch-comet/vhasti/temp_project/parat

Error on Globus while connecting to the above folders:

Directory Listing Timed Out
The server response may be slow or listing a very large number of files is taking too long.
