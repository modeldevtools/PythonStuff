Hello,

I am currently editing a code I regularly run on Comet. The following tasks are currently strangely slow: editing source files in a text editor, saving and closing the text editor, compiling the code, and submitting jobs. Normally these tasks run smoothly. Currently I need to wait tens of seconds every time I save a file.
