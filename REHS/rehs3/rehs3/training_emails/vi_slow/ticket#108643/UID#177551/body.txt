Hi

I am not sure if this is just me, but, login nodes on comet has been extremely slow. Even common tasks such as auto-complete, ls, less etc. take several seconds (or even minutes) to process. Also, it has been pretty hard to get access to an interactive compute node, but, assuming the system is pretty busy, that's completely understandable.

But, not being able to view log files or modify scripts has been frustrating and delaying.

I would appreciate if you can provide any suggestions or solutions to speed up. I've tried working on multiple wifi, including my University (which is pretty fast than my home network), but with no effect.

Thanks
Gaurav
