Last night it was very difficult to work with Comet.  For simple task likes changing a number in a batch file took several minutes.  Just typing vi batch12.txt could take a minute to load on the screen.  Then to enter a change in the file may or may not work.  Most times the screen just froze and nothing could be entered.  I needed to look at some output files, but again the screen would freeze before I could spool just a few pages.
  I gave up and tried again this morning.  Same problem, very slow internet exchange.
  Of course this could be a local problem, but I can easily communicate via the internet.  I have worked on my e-mails, and gone to the ACS ASAP list and downloaded a few papers to read.  No problem there.  All seems ok except for 
communications with Comet.  Have never seen this problem before and wonder if something is wrong?
