Hi:

I have a question on performance. I did a comparison between Comet and a NASA cluster using same problem and number of cores (600). The former is ~2 times slower even though NASA cores are of older generation (Sandy or Ivy bridge). I suspect I/O issues as I'm using

/oasis/scratch/comet/yinglong/temp_project/GulfStream/RUN11f
(I did notice how slowly the output files appear in outputs/)

I also played with optimization level of compiler etc but these did not affect the performance. My code dir is (in case you need it):

/home/yinglong/SCHISM/trunk/src

Could you please give me some advice? Thanks!

Joseph
