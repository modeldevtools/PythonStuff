I found out Vim editor is slow in my Comet account without any Vim plugin. It looks fine at first, but whenever I write down a few words or save the file, it freeze for a minute. I also took a look profile log of vim, but I couldn't find any specific reasons. Why such a lag happen?

On the other hand, Nano editor works fine. However, nano doesn't have enough feature for advanced programming, thus I'd like to use Vim. 

Thanks,
Sung
