Dear support team,

I (username: pgrete) am having issues using vim on the scratch filesystem.
For example, if I open a file (even a new/empty one) and paste a lot of 
text, vim just hangs and is unresponsive on the order of minutes 
(depending on the amount of text pasted). Similarly, simple file writes 
with vim also take a long time.
This problem has independently confirmed by another user of our 
allocation (username: kopec) with both vim and emacs.
Nano on the other hand works fine.
Is there anything I should add to me .vimrc to fix that issue?

Thanks,

Philipp
