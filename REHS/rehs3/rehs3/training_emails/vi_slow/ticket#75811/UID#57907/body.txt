Hi-
I'm working on a cluster at UCLA with the IP address 128.97.58.245.  I routinely get a broken pipe connection timeout when I try to upload my files via rsync to comet to run my simulations.  The files are quite large and it will take ~ 45 minutes to an hour to upload.
Is there a way to fix this issue?
