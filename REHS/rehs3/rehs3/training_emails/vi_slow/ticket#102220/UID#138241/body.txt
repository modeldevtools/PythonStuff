Dear Comet,

It seems like writing output files on /scratch is extremely slow right now. Furthermore, my GPU runs write part of the entire output. JobID 21076277 might be helpful to look at. In /oasis/scratch/comet/jaehbae/temp_project/gaps/3d/hr007_001mth_strat_tatm2_iso_32h, all gasxxx.dat files are supposed to have 1.6GBs in size, but only two of the five files seem to be written correctly. 

Thank you,
Jaehan Bae
