Yesterday and today, I have noticed that the response times in Comet has been unusually high (~ 3 - 5 mins). When I try to make edits to a file, my cursor is getting stuck for a long time. Once I try to save a file or exit a file without saving, it is taking a long time to exit vim and come back to the command prompt in terminal (~ 5 - 10 mins)
