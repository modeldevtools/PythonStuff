Hello xsede help,


We are students from Washington University in St. Louis, and we are trying to run a lammps script on the comet cluster. Our atomistic modeling class has 100,000 allocated hours. Currently, we are getting an error "MPID_Init (1332)...Channel initialization failure". I have attached our batchscript for your reference. Are you able to provide any insights on fixing this issue.


Thanks,


Lyndon
