Hello,


I am trying to run some pw.x calculations using Quantum Espresso on COMET and some of my jobs will run, but others fail with a mysteriously vague error that reads:


[comet-31-02.sdsc.edu:mpispawn_0][readLine] Unexpected End-Of-File on file descriptor 5. MPI process died?

[comet-31-02.sdsc.edu:mpispawn_0][mtpmi_processops] Error while reading PMI socket. MPI process died?

[comet-31-02.sdsc.edu:mpispawn_0][chile_handler] MPI process (rank: 4, pid 40280) terminated with signal 9 -> abort job

[comet-31-02.sdsc.edu:mpispawn_0][process_mpispawn_connection] mpispawn_0 from node comet-31-02 aborted: Error while reading a PMI socket (4)


or similar. Those lines are the only printed to the error file, so I'm just not sure where to start in troubleshooting this problem. Any help you could provide would be greatly appreciated, and I'm happy to provide you with example files, submit scripts, etc. if it's helpful.


Thanks,
