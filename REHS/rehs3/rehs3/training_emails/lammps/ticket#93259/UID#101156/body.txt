Hi,

My one particular job is crashing without giving much error. It has now crashed 3 times. This is a simple simulation of metals using LAMMPS. 

Three job numbers are 18607285, 18589847 and 18585426. Is it a memory problem? This job ran perfectly when i was running for smaller system. 

Any pointers on what is going wrong and what i can do to rectify it will be of great help.

Thank you,
Anu
