Hello,


I have a job running on Comet for 45 mins, but no out put has been generated so far. The folder containing the job is


"/oasis/scratch/comet/tengz/temp_project/triangulr-3d-pp-a1-Lc1200-Ro500-Ric100-bond-pnas-f01-g001-y100-lv"


and the job id is 11423216?.


Could you please help me take a look?


Thanks.


Best,

Teng
