Hi,



I am using my gmail account to send the following email since email bounces
back when I tried to send this using my university email sanjib@udel.edu.

Could you please tell me how I can create shell job script on the Putty
terminal? On the DOD machines, I usually use “module load lammps >
Submit_lammps > Job name > Add other files” commands to create such script.
But these don’t work on Comet for me. I would appreciate if can share such
scripts if you have.



Thank you.

Best regards,

Sanjib
