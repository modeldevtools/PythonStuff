Hi 
  Our jobs in comet are showing ‘R’ status but without any output being generated.
  The job ids are 18530318, 18530319, 18530320 and so on.
  The job output file is writing: "Unloading compiler-dependent module intelmpi/2016.3.210
mpiexec_comet-03-68.sdsc.edu: cannot connect to local mpd (/tmp/mpd2.console_jmondal); possible causes:
  1. no mpd is running on this host
  2. an mpd is running but was started without a "console" (-n option)”
