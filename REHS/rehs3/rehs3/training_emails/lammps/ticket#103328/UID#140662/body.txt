Hello,

I am user rmerani on comet cluster. I downloaded the LAMMPS source file and I modified it by adding my new function to it. Now, I am trying to make an executable file of this modified version of LAMMPS by on comet but I do not know how. I was wondering if you could help me to make an executable file of modified LAMMPS.


Thanks,

Ramin
