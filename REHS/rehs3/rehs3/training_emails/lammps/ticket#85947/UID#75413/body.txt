Hi,

We are writing a proposal about Xsede allocations and I am working on a report about the scalability of our simulations with LAMMPS software, when we use GPUs.

I followed the script, lammp-slurm-gpu.sb, available on /share/apps/examples/LAMMPS/; however, 
I am not sure if I understand the script and the generated output file:

For instance, in the log.lammps file I am not sure how to interpret the following lines, where "mpirun  -np $processors $EXE -sf gpu -pk gpu 1 -in in.lj.txt" has been used in the script: 

#################################
OUTPUT Line: "  1 by 2 by 3 MPI processor grid "

Qeustion: 
My guess is that when we use "--partition=gpu-shared" and "--ntasks-per-node=6" in the batch script, the GPUs have been used.
1) Have GPUs or CPUs been used?  

2) What does "-sf gpu -pk gpu 1" exactly mean?

###################################

###################################
OUTput lines: 
"Loop time of 0.144435 on 6 procs for 100 steps with 32000 atoms

Performance: 299096.133 tau/day, 692.352 timesteps/s
72.2% CPU use with 6 MPI tasks x 1 OpenMP threads"

Question: 
1) Shouldn't I expect to see lines such as "GPU Time Stamps:" in the output file?

2) What does "72.2% CPU use" mean given the fact GPUs have been requested?

Thanks for your help,
Hadi
