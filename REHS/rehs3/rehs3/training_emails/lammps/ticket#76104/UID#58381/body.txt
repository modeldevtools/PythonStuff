Hi,

I have been facing some issues running my LAMMPS scripts since today morning. The exact same code when executed before today ran smoothly without any issues. The queue shows that my script is being run, but I do not get any output data nor anything is being recorded in my log file. Can you please help me with this?

Thank you.

The following is my working directory:
/oasis/scratch/comet/spinge/temp_project/LiNe_scaleup/TICGvsMD/26k-b-26k/3X-multi/FT28nm/scaled_pitch/main_runs/new_trials/after_etch_below_Tg/0p01_solvent_trials

I submit jobs via the job_submit_script_test.in script and you can use the test.in for testing.
