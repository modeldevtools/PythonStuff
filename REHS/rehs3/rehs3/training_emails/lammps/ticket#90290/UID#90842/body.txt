Whenever I try to run a simulation on the Comet debug queue, I keep getting an error message about not being able to connect to a local mpd file. All of my simulations have timed out. I haven't used Comet in a while and this is the first time I've encountered this issue. I've attached the submit script as well as the .out file of the system which shows the message.

Thank you for your help.
