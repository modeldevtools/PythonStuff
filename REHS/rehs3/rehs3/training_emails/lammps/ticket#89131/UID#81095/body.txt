Hello,

I am graduate student in Chemical Engineering at MIT and we have access to the Comet Supercomputer through the XSEDE program. I am encountering a problem when running LAMMPS using the MC package (fix gcmc: http://lammps.sandia.gov/doc/fix_gcmc.html). Specifically, when I am running a molecular dynamics (MD) simulation using LAMMPS on Comet, the job gets stuck after running for around 1.5 ns. I see that the output files (*.log, *.out and dump file)  don't get updated with results from the next timesteps even through I can see that the job is running using the "squeue" command in the terminal. This means that my job is getting stuck at some timestep after which there is no output from the LAMMPS program. I have been using LAMMPS for quite sometime and have not encountered this kind of a problem before. Furthermore, I have run these simulations on a local cluster and they seem to be working fine. I was wondering if you could help me in identifying the cause for this problem and 
 if you have encountered similar issues with other users before. 
Any help would be much appreciated. Thanks in advance and I look forward to your reply.

Best regards,
Rahul
