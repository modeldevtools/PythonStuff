Hi, 

I wanted to use meam/c instead of meam in lammps. This is not installed in comet with the default lammps. Meam is unsupported now. So, is there any other version of lammps in comet? Other than this one, lammps/20170331(default). 

I tried to install and tried to run the executable from my home directory which I installed myself, but getting the below error, 

/home/avik/lammps-16Mar18/src/lmp_mpi: symbol lookup error: /home/avik/lammps-16Mar18/src/lmp_mpi: undefined symbol: __libm_error_support


My batch script is like below, 

#!/bin/bash
#SBATCH --job-name="Ge"
#SBATCH --output="lammps.comet.logs"
#SBATCH --partition=compute
#SBATCH --nodes=25
#SBATCH --ntasks-per-node=24
#SBATCH --export=ALL
#SBATCH -t 47:30:00
#SBATCH --mail-type=begin,end,fail,requeue
#SBATCH --mail-user=avik894@gmail.com

#This job runs with 16 nodes, 24 cores per node for a total of 384 cores.

#Load the CP2K module and find the executable
module load lammps
export EXE=`which lammps`

#Use ibrun to run the MPI job. It will detect the MPI, generate the hostfile
# and doing the right binding. With no options ibrun will use all cores.
export OMP_NUM_THREADS=1
mpirun /home/avik/lammps-16Mar18/src/lmp_mpi < in.melting


Any quick suggestion will be extremely helpful. 

Thanks
Avik
