Hello Admin,

I am a graduate student working with Professor Daniel Blankschtein in the Department of Chemical Engineering.

For the past week or so, I have not been able to run LAMMPS on Comet. While I can submit jobs, and the jobs start getting executed, the output file is blank. The job goes on to completion, but I cannot see anything in the output file. I have lost close to 5000 SUs because of this issue. Please help me in resolving this issue. For your reference, below, I am copy-pasting my job submission script,

Thank you,
Ananth Govind Rajan
