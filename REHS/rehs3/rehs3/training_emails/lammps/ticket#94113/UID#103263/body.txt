Hi Comet Tech,

I am struggling in get gromacs running on comet.
My basic command is:
module load gromacs/2016.3
export OMP_NUM_THREADS=24
ibrun gmx_mpi mdrun -v -deffnm step7_production 

Nothing comes out except:
mpiexec_comet-14-01.sdsc.edu: cannot connect to local mpd (/tmp/mpd2.console_cliao2); possible causes:
  1. no mpd is running on this host
  2. an mpd is running but was started without a "console" (-n option)

Can you help me with the correct command input for gromcas?
I am trying to submit 4 node*24 cores, 4 MPI tasks.

Thank you very much.

Chenyi
