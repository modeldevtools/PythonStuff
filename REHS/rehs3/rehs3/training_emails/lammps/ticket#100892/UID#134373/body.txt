Hi,


I am using my gmail account to send the following email since email bounces
back when I tried to send this using my university email sanjib@udel.edu.



I got startup allocation on Comet. I want to do benchmark molecular
dynamics simulations with LAMMPS using ReaxFF force field for silica-epoxy
interphase model.



1.   Could you please tell me how I can create shell job script on the
Putty terminal. On the DOD machines, I usually use “module load lammps >
Submit_lammps > Job name > Add other files” commands to create script. But
these don’t work on Comet for me.

2.   I would appreciate if can share such scripts if you have.



Thank you.

Best regards,

Sanjib
