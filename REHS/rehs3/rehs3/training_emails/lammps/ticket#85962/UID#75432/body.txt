Hello,

 I have a few python MPI jobs that I have successfully run in the past, and are now running fine for 3.5 hours, then aborting with the following message:

[comet-28-01.sdsc.edu:mpispawn_0][readline] Unexpected End-Of-File on file descriptor 12. MPI process died?
[comet-28-01.sdsc.edu:mpispawn_0][mtpmi_processops] Error while reading PMI socket. MPI process died?
[comet-28-01.sdsc.edu:mpispawn_0][child_handler] MPI process (rank: 0, pid: 29582) terminated with signal 9 -> abort job
[comet-28-01.sdsc.edu:mpirun_rsh][process_mpispawn_connection] mpispawn_0 from node comet-28-01 aborted: Error while reading a PMI socket (4)
[comet-28-38.sdsc.edu:mpispawn_14][read_size] Unexpected End-Of-File on file descriptor 29. MPI process died?

Any ideas? Thank you!
