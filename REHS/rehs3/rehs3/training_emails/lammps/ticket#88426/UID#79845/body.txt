Hi,

I am currently trying to run our MPI code. Despite using the exact same settings as the last time when it worked (December 2017), I cannot get the code to run. The error is quoted below.

We are using the modules:
module load intel/2016.3.210
module load intelmpi/2016.3.210
The code is located in:  /home/gwitzel/sgra_ps/code/c_code
and is called with ./red_n
we have a makefile: /home/gwitzel/sgra_ps/code/c_code/Makefile
we compile with 'make mpi'
we use sbatch COMET_MPI.sh
The code operates on data in: /home/gwitzel/sgra_ps/code/c_code
and is supposed to write into: /oasis/projects/nsf/cla168/gwitzel/test

Any help would be very much appreciated.

Thank you!

Gunther Witzel
