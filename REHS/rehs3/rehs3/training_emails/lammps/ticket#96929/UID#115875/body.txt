Dear colleagues at help desk,

I found the latests jobs submitted by sbatach command all failed in the past 2-3 hours.
The errors are as follows:

[comet-06-47.sdsc.edu:mpispawn_0][child_handler] MPI process (rank: 2, pid: 24418) terminated with signal 9 -> abort job
[comet-06-47.sdsc.edu:mpispawn_0][readline] Unexpected End-Of-File on file descriptor 16. MPI process died?
[comet-06-47.sdsc.edu:mpispawn_0][mtpmi_processops] Error while reading PMI socket. MPI process died?
[comet-06-47.sdsc.edu:mpirun_rsh][process_mpispawn_connection] mpispawn_0 from node comet-06-47 aborted: MPI process error (1)
IBRUN: Job ended with value 1

Could you take a look what happened to it? Thank you very much.

Bests
