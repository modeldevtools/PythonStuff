I would like to use the compute smd/vol command in LAMMPS. However, I receive an error that this compute style is unknown. This compute is part of the USER-SMD package and it is only enabled if LAMMPS was built with that package. Would it be possible to check if LAMMPS was built with the USER-SMD package? If it wasn't, could this be changed?

Thank you,
Brooklyn Noble
