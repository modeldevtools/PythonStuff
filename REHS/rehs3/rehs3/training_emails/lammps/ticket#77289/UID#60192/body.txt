Dear Admin,

I am trying to install a custom version of LAMMPS in my home directory.

After downloading the source files, and making the binary, I am getting the following error while attempting to execute the binary file:

./lmp_mpi: error while loading shared libraries: libmpichcxx.so.10: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory

Could you please help me in resolving this error?

Thank you very much
