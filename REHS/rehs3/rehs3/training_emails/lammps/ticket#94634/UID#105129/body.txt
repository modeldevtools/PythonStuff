Dear All,

I was trying to run a gormacs job on 4 k80 GPUs that I got the following error message:

mpiexec_comet-30-18.sdsc.edu: cannot connect to local mpd (/tmp/mpd2.console_panahiaf); possible causes:
  1. no mpd is running on this host
  2. an mpd is running but was started without a "console" (-n option)

 The job lingers in the q with R status but does not produce any outputs. You can find the job script at: 

/oasis/scratch/comet/panahiaf/temp_project/c99_mutants/D23N.1/charmm-gui/gromacs/run_prod_1.bash

The error out put is: test.out

Please let me know if I can provide more information.

I would appreciate it if you could help me with this.

Thank you.
