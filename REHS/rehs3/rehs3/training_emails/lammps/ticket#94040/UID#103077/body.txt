Dear Sir or Madam,

I am wondering how I can run LAMMPS with GPUs on comet with existing module. I can see cuda versions of executable in the /opt/lammps/bin folder, but I could not find which modules to load or an example submission script. If there is any resources of this kind, please direct me to those. 

Thank you very much.

Best,
Dongyue
