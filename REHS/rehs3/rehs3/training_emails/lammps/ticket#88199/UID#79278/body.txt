Hi, 

I have a MPI job that each ranks tries to load its own file and by loading that file it also creates a zipped index file. I have a barrier to make sure all ranks finish writing the index file. Then, each rank needs to load and read all the created files by other ranks. When I run my job on my local workstation it works. On Comet it works on a single node but when I go beyond one node my job fails by the following error:
  File "/home/mkhoshle/miniconda2/envs/ga4py/lib/python2.7/site-packages/numpy/lib/npyio.py", line 429, in load
IOError: Failed to interpret file '/oasis/scratch/comet/mkhoshle/temp_project/MPI-traj-split/files/.newtraj_4_1.xtc_offsets.npz' as a pickle

Which is weird. Do you know what might cause this problem?

Thanks,
