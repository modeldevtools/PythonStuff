Hello,
I am trying to run LAMMPS script on COMET. I am following the examples
given in the directory. However, I am getting an error

/opt/lammps/bin/lammps.60.cuda: error while loading shared libraries:
libnvidia-fatbinaryloader.so.367.48: cannot open shared object file: No
such file or directory

Could you please help me out. I am new to XSEDE and COMET resource. I am
using the same batch file given in the example.

Thank you,

Regards,
Abhay
