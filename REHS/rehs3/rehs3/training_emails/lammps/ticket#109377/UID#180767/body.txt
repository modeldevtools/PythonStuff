I was trying to run GROMACS(2016.3) on Comet with sbatch. According to 'module show' command, I should load gnu intel/2016.3.210 intelmpi. However, if I load intel mpi modules, I would run into error 'mpiexec_comet-12-27.sdsc.edu: cannot connect to local mpd (/tmp/mpd2.console_xiaoyulu); possible causes:
  1. no mpd is running on this host
  2. an mpd is running but was started without a "console" (-n option)' 

If I unload all intel modules, I cannot use gmx_mpi command with the error message 'gmx_mpi: error while loading shared libraries: libmkl_intel_lp64.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
/var/spool/slurmd/job23915681/slurm_script: line 20: mpirun: command not found'

Was wondering which modules shall I load for GROMACS. Thank you!
