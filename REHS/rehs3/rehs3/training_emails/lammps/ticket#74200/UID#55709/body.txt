Dear Sir/Madam,

This is Yuhang Jing. 
I am trying to compile Lammps software.
There are two problems:
First thing is I can login into Xsede system by using WinSCP, but I can not login into Comet system because I need to use Comet system to do computation. Do I need a new Comet username?
Second is I need to modify Lammps code and compile Lammps in Comet system, what should I do? Do you have any Makefile suitable for Comet system? Thank you.

Bests,
Yuhang
