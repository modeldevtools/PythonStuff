Hi,

I have found a bug in cluster version of pardiso included in MKL. I have
tried 2018 version of MKL (module not on Comet) and error persists. I would
like to try and run with different MPI to see if this fixes the problem.

How do I submit jobs using OpenMPI -- Do I use mpirun or ibrun? Do I need
to specify a hostfile?

Is there an example script for hybrid jobs using IntelMPI or OpenMPI? Or
any other reference to see for specific configuration on Comet?

Thanks,
James
