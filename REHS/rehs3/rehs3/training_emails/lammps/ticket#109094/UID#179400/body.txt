I am a new user on Comet. Our group uses a custom version of LAMMPS that other people are using without issue. When I attempt to run a simulation, I do not get all of the expected output files. For example, in my /oasis/projects/nsf/lhu116/erk319/Prof_actin_sim/low_temp directory, my log.lammps does not contain any timetrace information as expected. I thought that I should try to recompile my version of LAMMPS (directory here: /home/erk319/PROGRAMS/SVN_24Jul2013_comet/src), so I ran

make clean-all

Then, I ran 

make comet

and I go this error: 

Catastrophic error: could not set locale "" to allow processing of multibyte characters

I would like help solving my compilation problem with LAMMPS so I can try to rerun my simulations to see if I get the expected output.
