Hi,

I ran the LAMMPS code on Comet with the example provided in /share/app/examples/LAMMPS
It returned an error says:

/opt/lammps/bin/lammps: /usr/lib64/libstdc++.so.6: version `CXXABI_1.3.8' not found (required by /opt/lammps/bin/lammps)
/opt/lammps/bin/lammps: /usr/lib64/libstdc++.so.6: version `CXXABI_1.3.8' not found (required by /opt/lammps/bin/lammps)
/opt/lammps/bin/lammps: /usr/lib64/libstdc++.so.6: version `GLIBCXX_3.4.15' not found (required by /opt/lammps/bin/lammps)
/opt/lammps/bin/lammps: /usr/lib64/libstdc++.so.6: version `GLIBCXX_3.4.20' not found (required by /opt/lammps/bin/lammps)

Could you please help with it?

Best wishes,
Wenwu
