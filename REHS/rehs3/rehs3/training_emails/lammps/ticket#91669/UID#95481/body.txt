Hello,

I am trying to benchmark gromacs simulations on comet p100 GPUs. I used the following file run_test_ibrun.sb to run simulation some six months ago. However, the simulation did not start and I received the following:

Unloading compiler-dependent module mvapich2_ib/2.1
IBRUN ERROR: No recognized MPI modules appear to be loaded.  Load an MPI module before using ibrun

I then switched ibrun to srun and received a separate error in the output file test.out. which states that:


mpiexec_comet-33-15.sdsc.edu: cannot connect to local mpd (/tmp/mpd2.console_jermelgr); possible causes:
  1. no mpd is running on this host
  2. an mpd is running but was started without a "console" (-n option)

Currently I am at a loss on how to proceed

Thank you and regards,
Jermel
