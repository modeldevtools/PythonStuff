Hi, 
I ran into trouble trying run lammps with gpu on comet.
I'm unable to run the example job script provided on comet for lammps with gpu. 

I get the error

/opt/lammps/bin/lammps.37.cuda: error while loading shared libraries: libnvidia-fatbinaryloader.so.367.48: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory

I was hoping I can learn how to use the installed LAMMPS software with GPU on Comet. 

Thanks, 
Amulya
