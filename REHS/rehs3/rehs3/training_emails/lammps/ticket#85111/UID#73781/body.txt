Hello, 

I'm want to use OpenKIM(openkim.org) library, and API with LAMMPS. I tried to compile lammps by my self with "wget http://lammps.sandia.gov/tars/lammps-8Mar18.tar.gz" 
but it's throwing an error "make: *** No rule to make target `mpi'.  Stop." 

Can you please help me to make OpenKIM works with the LAMMPS.
Thank you very much.
