Hi,

I am trying to run an application with a combination of OpenMP and MPI, and I want to specify the number of cores being used for the MPI component and the number of cores being used as OpenMP threads.  

In mpirun, this can be done as the following “mpirun —map-by ppr:N:node:pe=M” where N processors are requested with M threads each.  However, I cannot find a way to do it with “ibrun”. Is there such a way? 

The reason I ask is that I am trying to optimize the performance of this code on the machine.  The code is designed to analyze different snapshots of data using  N processors and each snapshot is analyzed by M threads with OpenMP.  I hope this makes sense. 

Jake
