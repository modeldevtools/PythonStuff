For some cases of my lammps calculation, the lammps software can not generate valid data file. The normal data file generate should be about 210 MPa according to my atoms number. However, these cases only generate 8MPa data file, which loss many valid information. 
I have test this job case in my local PC and other cluster. This problem does not exist. 

Other lammps calculation jobs in comet are work fine. Only for the specific cases
The case locate at  /oasis/projects/nsf/umr112/zhoumst/5/001.
