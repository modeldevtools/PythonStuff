Hello,

I was working on the GPU (running CHARMM/OpenMM) and the job simply stopped, with the output job file stating "[comet-33-06.sdsc.edu:mpispawn_0][child_handler] MPI process (rank: 0, pid: 35755) terminated with signal 6 -> abort job
[comet-33-06.sdsc.edu:mpirun_rsh][process_mpispawn_connection] mpispawn_0 from node comet-33-06 aborted: MPI process error (1)"

What is this error and do you have any suggestions in dealing with this?

Best,
Ryan
