Hello XSEDE,


I'm working on Comet trying to run LAMMPS simulations, however for the past few days I started getting an error immediately as the jobs started to run. This is the error in my testfile:

IBRUN ERROR: No recognized MPI modules appear to be loaded.  Load an MPI module before using ibrun.


This is my list of current modules:

$ module list

Currently Loaded Modulefiles:
  1) intel/2016.3.210      2) intelmpi/2016.3.210   3) mkl/11.1.2.144        4) lammps/20170331       5) gnutools/2.69


It appears that I have MPI loaded, yet I get an error saying otherwise. If you can help in any way it would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!


All the best,
