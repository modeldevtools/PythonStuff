Hi,

I was able to run lammps successfully on Comet several weeks ago. However, the version of lammps has been changed recently and my preliminary simulations with the new version (lammps/20170331) suggests that ibrun might not work with lammps.

New errors occur when I use:
module load lammps
ibrun -np 48 lammps < in.soft > OUTequil   # (or other commands in other modes)

Fatal error in MPI_Init: Other MPI error, error stack:
MPIR_Init_thread(784).................:
MPID_Init(1332).......................: channel initialization failed
MPIDI_CH3_Init(141)...................:
dapl_rc_setup_all_connections_20(1388): generic failure with errno = 872614415
getConnInfoKVS(849)...................: PMI_KVS_Get failed

( Here is the part of submission script:

#!/bin/bash
#SBATCH --job-name="N192-nb1"
#SBATCH --output="N192-nb1.%j.%N.out"
#SBATCH --partition=compute
#SBATCH --nodes=2
#SBATCH --ntasks-per-node=24
#SBATCH --export=ALL
#SBATCH -t 00:30:00
#SBATCH --mail-user=dinpajooh@gmail.com
#SBATCH --mail-type=begin  # email me when the job starts
#SBATCH --mail-type=end    # email me when the job finishes

module load lammps
ibrun -np 48 lammps < in.soft > OUTequil
)

I tried using mpirun and it seems to be working, but I am not sure it is as efficient as the ibrun when it was working.

Can you please let me know your comments about the latest version of lammps and running it efficiently?

Thanks,
Hadi Dinpajooh
