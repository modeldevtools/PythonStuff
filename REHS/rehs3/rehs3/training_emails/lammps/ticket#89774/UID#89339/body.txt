Hi,

I'm currently having issues in installing gromacs 2018 patched with plumed
2.4.1 locally on Comet. I've even tried gromacs 2016.4 but the patching
problem is still there. I wonder if it is possible to have installed
gromacs 2018 patched with plumed 2.4.1 on Comet as module?
Even gromacs 2016.4 instead would be ok.

Thank you very much,
Stefania
