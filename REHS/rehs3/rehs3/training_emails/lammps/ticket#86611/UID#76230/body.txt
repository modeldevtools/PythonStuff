Hello,

I'm using OVITO(www.ovito.org) to post-process the results of LAMMPS jobs in my university cluster. In that case, the way it works is; I've OVITO installed in my MAC and I can access the LAMMPS output file by establishing a remote connection(sftp) between my MAC and university cluster. But if I try to do the same thing from XSEDE it throws the error. So can you please help me to either solve this issue or to install the OVITO in your cluster itself.

Thank you.
