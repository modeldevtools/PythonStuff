Mahidhar:
I see this error for lammps job on comet. Should we be using mpiexec or mpirun.

Thanks,
Sudhakar.

mpiexec_comet-07-66.sdsc.edu: cannot connect to local mpd (/tmp/mpd2.console_gridchem); possible causes:
  1. no mpd is running on this host
  2. an mpd is running but was started without a "console" (-n option)
