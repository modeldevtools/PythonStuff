Hi there,

I am sorry to bother you. I tried to compile my version of LAMMPS not the default one on comet. The thing is during compilation, there are always no reference to mpi library. I saw on the user portal, mvapich2 module is loaded automatically. And I set the path for mvapich2 in my make file. I think it's correct. So I wonder whether we can compile our modified LAMMPS version on comet. Thanks. 

Best,
Shiyi
