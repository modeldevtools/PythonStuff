Hi Ken and Stephen-
Project PHY100053, PI Frans Preorius,  were awarded an advance of 490,400SUs on 9/28, however the original allocation expired 9/30, so they did not get much use of it.  They expected that with the advance there would be an automatic extension until new allocation would take effect, Jan 1.  As they did not request the extension prior to end date, they no longer have the ability to do it themselves.  Can you either open up an opportunity for it,  or just push through an extension. 

this is associated with ticket [tickets.xsede.org #76358] 
Thanks,
Nicole
