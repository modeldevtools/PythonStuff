Dear Sir/Madam,


My name is Anand Chandrasekaran and I am a postdoc at UConn. My xsede username is anandc. I currently have two project allocation on xsede (TG-DMR170038 and TG-DMR080058N).


However, only one of these allocations is available when I type show_accounts in comet. Could you kindly help me with this.


Kind regards,

Anand
