Hello,

I'm putting together a proposal for a supplement/extension of resources
allotted on the Comet cluster. To that end, it would be useful if I could
benchmark how many SUs a single specific job required. I only know of the
long time chart where I can see on a given day how many jobs were run and
SUs consumed in aggregate. Is there a tool where I can see individual job
usages?

Thank you,
Charles McGill
