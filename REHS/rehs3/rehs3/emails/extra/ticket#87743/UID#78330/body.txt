Hello,

It has come to to my attention that many of my jobs were sent to the wrong computational partition. I have been running hundreds of parallel single core jobs us ing multi-walker metadynamics using SCC-DFTB as they have been shown to scale well to explore the multidimensional free-energy phase-space of phosphoryl transfer reactions. To ensure broad sampling efficiently, hundreds of single core jobs were employed. However, it was not necessarily clear to me that the 'compute' partition requests a whole node. As such, each job was billed for a factor of x24. I'd hate for this misunderstand to negatively impact the rest of my group's allocation and am wondering is there any way to petition some clawback for allocation.
