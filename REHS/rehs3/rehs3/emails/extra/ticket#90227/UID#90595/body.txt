Hello,

I am a PhD student in Mark Hildebrand's lab performing genetic research in a marine algae.

I have run into some computing barriers concerning run time and memory for some of the bioinformatic analyses I am interested in running. It's possible that these can be overcome using some of the resources at XSEDE, specifically the comet cluster, but I need to perform some initial tests in order to get a sense of how many SU's to request for a startup allocation.

The website (https://portal.xsede.org/allocations/startup#sulimits) gives the impression that a formal request isn't necessary to get access to the comet cluster to run some of these preliminary analyses, is this correct? If so I was hoping to request a startup allocation on the Comet cluster for 1,000 SUs.

Thank you,

Sarah lerch
