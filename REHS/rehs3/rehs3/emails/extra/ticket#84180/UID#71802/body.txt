Hi,

Are there any storage limits or quotas on the lustre filesystem on 
Comet, specifically on /oasis/scratch/comet/$USER/temp_project and 
/oasis/projects/nsf? If so, what are these limits? I get disk quota 
exceeded errors fequently, and I've been trying to remove some older 
files but I think that's not possible any more. And I'd like to know 
what these limits are so I can move files to long term storage as needed.

Thanks,

Rukmani
