Dear Comet Help,
         I work with Dr. Marco Caricato, and we were recently awarded a research allocation of ~900K SUs, but the account does not show up when I log in and run show_accounts. The only results I get is kan111, which shows 50K SUs and I believe is the 50K awarded to our campus champion. How do I get myself added to the correct project?
Thanks,
          Tal Aharon
