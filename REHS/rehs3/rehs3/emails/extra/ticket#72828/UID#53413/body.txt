Hi,

I tried out a demanding calculation last night, and received the following in the output log file after the program run was terminated by slurm:

slurmstepd: Exceeded step memory limit at some point.

This was unexpected because the same calculation completed with no trouble on a desktop computer in my group.

Could you please explain the error, and perhaps how I can avoid or overcome it?

This calculation was done on a "shared" node.

Thanks

Jon
