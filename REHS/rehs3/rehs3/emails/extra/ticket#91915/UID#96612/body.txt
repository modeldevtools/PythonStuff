Hello,

Earlier today I realized I am in 3 different groups on comet: 8652 (slc125), 7540 (ucb131), and 9946 (slc133). I also realized that when I ssh to comet, the default group is slc125. 

However, all the jobs I submitted this past year (one in April, and a couple hundred over the past month or so) should have been charged to group slc133, and counted towards Charge # TG-CHE170062. 

Would it be possible to credit group slc125 Charge # TG-CCG140008 with the 11202.0 SUs I have used from that allocation, and deduct that many from group slc133 Charge # TG-CHE170062? We have 113858.0 of 167813.0 SUs remaining on this allocation, so there's more than enough to cover it.

Sorry for the mistake,

Michael DeLyser
