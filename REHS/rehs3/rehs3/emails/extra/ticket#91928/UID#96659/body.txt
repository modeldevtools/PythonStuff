Hello,

I've recently run into an issue where one of my users charged a large number of expensive jobs to my startup allocation over a very short period of time. I was aware of what he was doing, and I noticed during the time that these charges were occurring, so I am partially to blame as well. However, if I had more control over his usage, I could have avoided something like this by analyzing his usage habits before it became a big problem.

Is there a way to allocate only a percentage of a total allocation to various users?

Thanks,

Loren Greenman
