I recently submitted a ticket about being unable to access the advance resources awarded to allocation TG-CHE160009. Steven Deems replied quite promptly with screenshots showing that XSEDE has credited our account. This is confirmed by the fact that our users' XSEDE portals reflect the advance, but the terminal interface still does not show this and we can therefore not submit jobs using this allocation.

What actions should be carried out to rectify this so that our users can use the allocation?
