Dear XSEDE help,

     I am working on a startup allocation for XSEDE
for a OpenMP/MPI code in which I would like to run
for ~1000 cores for 4-8 hours at a time. If the
scaling on these large-scale runs is good enough,
then I will perform several production runs. My memory
requirements are not large. The MPI communication is
also not large, but only happens periodically
to improve the proposal distribution for the
Markov Chain Monte Carlo. The HDF5 I/O is performed
at the end and only performed by one core in each
node and will be a few GB per node. The code is
written in C++/Fortan and requires a relatively recent
compiler, but there are several flags to enable
compiling on systems which don't have full C++11
support. I do not have any code that can run on
GPUs yet.

     My initial guesses are that I should propose
using Bridges regular memory or Comet, but I
wanted to know if you had other recommendations.
Please feel free to let me know if you need more
information from me.

Thank you,
Andrew
