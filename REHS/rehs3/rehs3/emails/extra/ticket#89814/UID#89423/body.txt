We are having an issue with a extremely high number of SUs being consumed on our account. My allocation usage in my xsede account shows when I hover over a usage peak with my mouse that I have used 594 SUs at the end of this week. However, the axis of the graph shows that I have used over 4000K SUs. Our allocation has dropped from 3% to 1% in a matter of days with only a few jobs being run per day as a group.
