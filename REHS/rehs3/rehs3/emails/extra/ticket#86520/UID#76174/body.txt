Hi.  I have a set of runs that could run up tp 216 case studies.  This can be submitted as one (trivial) MPI job, or as an array job.

It seems that an array job would be more efficient?  That is, when any job in an array is complete, its SU count ends.  So I would use
#SBATCH --array=1-256
It would be more convenient if I could use something like:
#SBATCH --array=1-24,101-124,201-224,301-324,401-424,501-524,601-624,701-724,801-824,901-924
Is there a max array size?

Is my assumption correct that a batch MPI keeps all its assigned SUs active?  E.g., I would submit
#SBATCH --nodes=9
#SBATCH --ntasks-per-node=24

Thanks.

Lester
