I would like to use comet-gpu instead of comet-cpu.  It said on the web page for comet that you can transfer time to comet-gpu using XRAS, but I'm not sure how to do this.  Can you offer me any guidance?

Also, if it is possible to transfer time to comet-gpu, would it also be possible to have numpy and tensorflow 1.5.0 installed as modules?  Thanks!
