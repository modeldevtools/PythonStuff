Mahidhar,

I am having trouble connecting to the server.  I am using Putty and
WinSCP.  It shows the error, "Host not connecting in 100 second. Aborting
....". I tried the basic options like checking off ' optimize connection
buffer size' and increasing the 'time out period'. It did not work.  Since
David is able to work, I don't think the server is down.  It would be
helpful if you can suggest any solution to this problem.

Thanks.
