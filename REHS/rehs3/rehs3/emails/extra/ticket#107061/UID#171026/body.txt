Mahidhar or  colleague,

I am trying to use my Startup Allocation in the next few weeks and I need a
faster way to monitor that SU burn status than the Portal graph -- I
suppose.

My last run, x-haloHern: job number ______ (but could be found) was 10
hours on 720 processors (30 nodes at 24 processors per node), but I don't
see that 7, 200 SUs subtracted from my allocation on the graph.

I should only have about 13, 000 SUs left, which I could use today.

I decided not to apply for a Research Allocation because I don't have
enough experience to write the code document.

I will apply for a renewal of my  present Startup Allocation.

I will read the portal about asking for more SUs before the end of an
allocation, but if you have a tip please let me read it.

Best,

johnny powell
