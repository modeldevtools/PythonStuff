Dear XSEDE and SDSC Help Desk,

Many thanks for recent educational allocation for my CHME 461 course. I really appreciate it. (Request # ENG180006 (New))

There are ten students in the course. Is it possible to set up ten user accounts for the students in this course? What is the preferred way to go about this?

Sincerely,

Tom Manz
