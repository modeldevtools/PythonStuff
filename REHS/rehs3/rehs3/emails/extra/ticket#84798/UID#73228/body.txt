Hi - Looks like what I did --> filling out a request on Comet for a trial was wrong as you can see below. So now, it looks like what I should have done was to send a request to you for a trial run on Comet. All of the information as to reasoning, etc. are in the OCE180006 request if you would like to delve into it more.
I assume this is al I have to do but please let me know it I need to do anything more.
Tom
