Hello, A few weeks ago the scripts i was running were creating an extremely high file count until now where I had fixed the error. I have been running them fine these past two weeks, but now I hit a 'Disk Space Limit' and wanted to know if this could be lifted off now that my code is working properly. Thanks.
