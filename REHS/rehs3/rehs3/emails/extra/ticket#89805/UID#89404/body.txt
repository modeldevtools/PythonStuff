Dear Marty,
I am presently tying to calculate the Gaussian G4 enthalpy and structure for ethylhexylcyclopentane and I seem to be running out of memory.
What can I do to fix this? the output tail is

[dwrogers@comet-ln2 June]$ tail ethexcy52.out
 T4(AAB)= -0.29263703D-01
 T5(AAA)=  0.65739078D-04
 T5(AAB)=  0.97925520D-03
 Time for triples=    93705.16 seconds.
 T4(CCSD)= -0.61827906D-01
 T5(CCSD)=  0.20899885D-02
 CCSD(T)= -0.50935466350D+03
