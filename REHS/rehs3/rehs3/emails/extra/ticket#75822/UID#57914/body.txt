Hi
We have an allocation of 60000.0 SUs in comet machine, the project name and number are: Multidimensional Modeling of NOx Formation in High Hydrogen Content Fuels Combustion in Gas Turbine Applications | TG-CTS170024.
I have problem running the reconstruct script for the run in /oasis/scratch/comet/arhan12/temp_project/test3_100ppmNO/TEST, the output tar file does not include all the tecplot output .plt files. Currently, the test3_100ppmNO file contains all the tar files for job #10821011. Since Mr. Mahidhar Tatineni wrote the scripts for me, please forward this email to him if possible=
