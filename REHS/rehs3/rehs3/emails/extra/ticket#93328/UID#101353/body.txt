It seems like I'm not able to submit jobs anymore on Comet - using the same submit scripts that have worked before for Quantum Espresso (attached), the job gets queued and immediately fails a few seconds after its actually distributed to the nodes. My allocation ( crl150 ) should still have plenty of SUs left. I know I had a little trouble a while back because I was taking too much space, but I deleted a lot of files and think I should be ok by now? Is there any way to figure out what's going on? Thank you!
