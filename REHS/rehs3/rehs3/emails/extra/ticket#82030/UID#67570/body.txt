Hi there, I have an account on comet (aka I can log in and access resources). I can also run python, but I was wondering if I have access to submitting jobs and if not, how I get access.

My username is bnevin.

If I have access I'm wondering how to submit shell scripts and also where to store my additional python modules. 

Thank you!
