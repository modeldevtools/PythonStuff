Execution Error in Gaussian09.  Exceeded step memory limit at some point.

I have not seen this error before.  There is not much on the internet about this error.  It seems however to be a systems problem.  I tried three times to resubmit the job.  On the third try the first job ran to completion in ca,. 20 minutes, but the second job called the same error in just 30 seconds of run time.
