Hi! I have some questions about charging. I'm just a little confused of how the SUs are calculated. In the comet user guide, it says "A node-exclusive job that runs on a compute node for one hour will be charged 24 SUs (24 cores x 1 hour)".  In that case, if I state how many cores I'm going to use, then the SUs will be calculated by the number of cores, is that correct? For example, if I write it explicitly on the script as "#SBATCH --nodes=1  #SBATCH --ntasks-per-node=3", then for this job with only one core, running 2 hours will cost 6 SU instead of 48 SUs?
