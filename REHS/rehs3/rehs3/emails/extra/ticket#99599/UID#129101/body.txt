Hi, per previous advice from Andrea Zonca at UCSC, I am requesting his assistance using the ECSS we have on this project.  Please pass this on to him at zonca@sdsc.edu.

Andrea, I modified the cluster.tf file (attached), ran terraform_init.sh, and then got errors after running terraform_apply.sh, also attached.  I ran "openstack servers list" to see if any servers got spun up, but none did. Let me know your thoughts; thanks!
