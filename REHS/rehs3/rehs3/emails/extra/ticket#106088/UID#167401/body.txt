Hi,

I noticed that I could not open any X-windows as I used to and I  am getting the following error when I try to run one of my IDL programs.

% LOADCT: Loading table RAINBOW
% TVLCT: Unable to connect to X Windows display: :0.0
% TVLCT: Unable to open X Windows display.
           Is your DISPLAY environment variable set correctly?

I would appreciate it if you could look into this when you get a chance.

Thanks a lot!
Bala
