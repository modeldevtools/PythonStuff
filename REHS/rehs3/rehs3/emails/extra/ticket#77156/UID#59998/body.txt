Hi, 

I submitted the ticket on last year 7/6/16 regarding to find the correct flag for my code. Mr. Mahidhar Tatineni
Helped me to solve this problem. I have one question regarding to that ticket. I just want to know that did he change anything inside my code or did he only play with flags?

If you want I can resend the email as well.

Thanks, Neda
