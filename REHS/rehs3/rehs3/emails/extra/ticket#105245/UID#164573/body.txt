Dear SDSC Staff,

We are requesting an additional 1.5 TB of Project Storage on SDSC Data Oasis to supplement the 500 GB we received with the startup allocation TG-CHE180099. This start-up has allowed us to rapidly generate long time-scale trajectories for electrostatic field analysis, on the order of µs using Comet-GPUs. While we have been able to obtain trajectories on a time scale that should allow for optimal sampling, we are lacking data storage for these trajectories on longer time scales. Currently, we have no supplemental HPC storage allocated through the University of Utah’s CHPC. Furthermore, SDSC Data Oasis is readily accessible and conducive for trajectory analysis as each of these trajectories are run on Comet-GPUs and would optimally be able to analyzed and compared and stored in the same location. Our current storage rate is ~ 100 GB for 300 ns of molecular dynamics. Trajectories are stored in binary NetCDF format to minimize storage space. A table summarizing the number of di
 fferent systems we will calculate as well as total storage required to complete this work.
