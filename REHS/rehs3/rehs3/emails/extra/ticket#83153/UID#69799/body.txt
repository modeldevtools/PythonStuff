I have a question regarding our account on Comet, and I hope that you can help me.
 
One of my post-docs is leaving, and heâ€™s been the person performing the computation on Comet.  Is there a way to ensure continuity, for example by moving his codes and data to my account till we recruit a new member? 
 
Cheers
Tamer
