Hi,

I'm trying to transfer a large data file (~300gb) to our project file storage:

/oasis/projects/nsf/nwu143/cwp710

and I've been getting the following error:

buffer_append_space: alloc 67141632 not supported

Is it an issue with our allocation? 

On a different note, we are trying to use this data as training dataset for our machine learning model. When we submit a job, can we tell the machine learning model to directly train from the project file space or should we transfer the data to one of the scratch file systems and train from there? If so, I read that such scratch file systems have a limit on the size. If our data exceeds the size limit for the scratch file system, how should we proceed in accessing the data during a job?

Thank you
