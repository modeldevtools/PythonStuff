Dear Admin,
I submitted two jobs yesterday on GPU nodes and following are the
submission directories for the same

/oasis/projects/nsf/nji105/kghatak/Adsorption/hollow
/oasis/projects/nsf/nji105/kghatak/Adsorption/clean_slab

The following error is coming in the error file:

*slurmstepd: Exceeded job memory limit at some point.*

Is there any way to increase the memory for the running job using this
command:
#SBATCH --mem X?

Thanks for your time and cooperation.

Regards,
-Kamalika
