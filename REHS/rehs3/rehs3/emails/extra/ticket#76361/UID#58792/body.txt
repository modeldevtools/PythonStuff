After I ssh using ssohub and "gsissh comet", comet-gpu account doesn't show up when I run "show_accounts". It only shows the comet like this:

ID name      project      used     available    used_by_proj
------------------------------------------------------------
pqiao        iit104       0        50000        0       

But I should have two projects comet and comet-gpu. Can I use gpu on Comet directly?
