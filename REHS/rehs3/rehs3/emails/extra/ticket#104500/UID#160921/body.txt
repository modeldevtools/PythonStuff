Dear XSEDE team,

I'm currently trying to use the Oasis storage from Comet, and it appears
there is an intermittent slowness that prevents access for several minutes
at a time. I'm not sure if I'm using the proper location, or if I'm missing
something here. My data is located in /oasis/projects/nsf/get140/lrr, but
my allocation report in the XSEDE user portal indicates an usage of 0 SUs.
Did I misunderstand how the locations work?

Thanks a lot!
Miguel (lrr).
