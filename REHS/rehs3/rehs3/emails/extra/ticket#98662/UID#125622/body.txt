To whom it may concern,

I cannot submit job on comet GPU and it says we don’t have enough quota. However, I found that we still have 2101 SUs on comet GPU. We are catching up a conference deadline and we are wondering if it’s possible to overdraw some SUs as we may not have time to wait for transferring SUs.

Thanks,
Yu
