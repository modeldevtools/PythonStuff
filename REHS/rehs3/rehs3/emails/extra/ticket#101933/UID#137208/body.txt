Hello,

I am planning to transfer some data to Comet Scratch for running a simulation. I just wanted to know how much disk space is available per user to store data on Lustre Comet scratch filesystem (/oasis/scratch/comet/$USER/temp_project).

I searched through the user guide online, which gave information on the total storage available, but I was not able to find information on the quota per user.

Thanks for you help!

Josin
