Hi Nichole,

Thanks for all your help, but got to bother you a little bit more. Since we cannot manage our allocation through XSEDE portal, how we can manage the archival and active usage space shared by multiple ABCD project users?

I tried to query through command "quota", but it is not that clear to me how is this managed. Since we have to upload several images and genetic data shared by our group, I wonder how it is achieved without going through XSEDE portal.

Meanwhile, Hauke reminded me that we have two projects each requests resources. One under his for ABCD the other under mine as genetic project. How should we partition them given we currently can only check by account if not using XSEDE portal?

Sorry to keep pestering you about this. But it is critical for our projects to move forward using comet now.

Best,
Chun
