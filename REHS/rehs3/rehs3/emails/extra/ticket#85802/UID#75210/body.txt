Dear Sir/Madam,

I am a PHD student at Duke University and my Id in XSEDE is "reza1789". I want to share a folder in my comet directory (my simulation result) with one of my co-worker that we both use the same allocation. Could you please guide me how can I do that?

In advance, I appreciate your time and effort.

Best,

Reza
