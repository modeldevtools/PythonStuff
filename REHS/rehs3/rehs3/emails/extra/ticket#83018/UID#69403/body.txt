Dear Chris,

Thanks for your email. So far our project goes on very well. We are preparing two manuscripts to summarize our recent work on the Raman spectra of InSe layers and are sure to have something to report soon.

However, we do have a problem at this moment. My student Lucas used up almost all computing times on Comet last month (he didn't pay attention to the balance) for his thesis project. Although I submitted a renewal proposal to xsede, I don't know when and how many we will be awarded. I wonder whether there is any way for us to get some small amount of computing time to finish some calculations. He needs some additional data for his 2018 APS March meeting talk, which will be held next month.

Thank you very much in advance!

Best,
Jia-An
