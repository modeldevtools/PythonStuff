Hello,

My PI, Prof. Benny Gerber from UCI, recently got a research allocation on Comet (I am the allocation manager):

"Atomistic Simulations of Heterogeneous Chemistry of N2O5 on the Surface of Pure and Salty Water Aerosols | TG-CHE170064"

While I can see the allocation on XSEDE user portal, it does not appear when I type "show_accounts" on Comet. 

I was wondering why that was and if you could help resolve the issue.

Thanks!
Barak
