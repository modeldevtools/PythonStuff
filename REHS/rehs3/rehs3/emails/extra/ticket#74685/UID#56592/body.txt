Hi Mahidhar,

I hope this mail finds you well.

I wonder if Comet has GPUs available (sorry if I have asked this before) and if yes how I could access them while running a program. I intent to run a Python code for recurrent neural network (LSTM to be precise) analysis. 

I havenâ€™t uploaded the programs yet but I can do that later today.

Thanks a lot and I look forward to hearing from you soon.

With regards,
Bala
