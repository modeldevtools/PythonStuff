Hello,



SimVascular gateway (https://gateway.simvascular.org) community login (svuser) for comet is throwing the highlighted error [1] when tries to create the working directories.

I tried to view the quota usage using quota â€“u svuser and that fails with [2].



Please look in to this and advice on best way to clean up quota space.



[1]

cannot create directory `/oasis/scratch/comet/svuser/temp_project/simvascular_workdirs/PROCESS_4004eb87-e681-4c5e-963b-0ac3cf808dff': Disk quota exceeded



[2]

[svuser@comet-ln3 ~]$ quota -u svuser

quota: error while getting quota from ps-073.sdsc.edu:/ps-data/janssen3/ for svuser (id 516267): Connection refused

quota: error while getting quota from ps-009.sdsc.edu:/ps-data/ngbt/ for svuser (id 516267): Connection refused

quota: error while getting quota from ps-038.sdsc.edu:/ps-data/nsg/ for svuser (id 516267): Connection refused



Thanks,

Eroma
