Hi...

Proverbial dumb question:  I have a new allocation with 50000 SUs (TG-CTS170026); I had a trial "Rapid Access" allocation before that.  The sbatch system seems to be limiting me to my previous trial allocation and not my "main" one.  When I try to run it gives me very limited resources, and is billing to my previous (TG-ASC150024) allocation.  How can I get access to TG-CTS170026 ?

Thanks,
Murph O'Dea
