Dear Help:


In running dDocent, there is an early phase of the run that is interactive followed by a phase where I move it to the backgroud


http://ddocent.com/UserGuide/#running


but I am running into the following error:


[skimble5@comet-ln2 demultiplexed_samples_no_RAD_check_gzipped_assembled_trim]$ Error occurred during initialization of VM

Could not allocate metaspace: 1073741824 bytes

mawk: cannot open uniq.fq1 (No such file or directory)

/home/skimble5/installs/dreqs/dDocent: line 690: * 5 / 4: syntax error: operand expected (error token is "* 5 / 4")


1.) Is this an issue of limited memory? If so, I can set the memory allocation to 120G but the error persists.


2.) Would sbatching the job help? If so, how can I do that? There is the option in dDocent of running with a configuration file


http://ddocent.com/UserGuide/#running-with-configuration-file


but see the first line on that page: "If dDocent is not being used for de novo assembly, it may be run in non-interactive mode and configuration parameters can be entered with a configuration file. " I AM running de novo ass

sembly.


3.) Would this also solve the mawk and syntax errors?


Thanks,

Steve

Data Reduction. For all assembly methods, dDocent uses a novel data reduction approach to help ensure accuracy. For PE methods, all reads are concatenated into single forward and reverse FASTA files, and for the SE method, only forward reads are used.
