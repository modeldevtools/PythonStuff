Hi there,

Software: Nek5000

Path: /oasis/scratch/comet/peterae/temp_project/CPU1728

Command: vi naca0012.log

There is an error message: 
gs_setup: 4087801 unique labels shared
   pairwise times (avg, min, max): 0.000151135 0.000102019 0.000190616
ERROR (proc 0975, src/gs.c:687): allocation of 388352 bytes failed

I am positive that my case set-up should be OK because I successfully ran it in Stampede2. However, I may not fully understand the configuration of Comet or there is a compatibility issue.

Somehow, my another job in the path :/oasis/scratch/comet/peterae/temp_project/CPU528
is running well. In fact, this case had the same problem in the beginning, but then I cancelled the job and reran it. Now, it is running well.

It will be great if you can take a look and help me out.

Best,
Peter
