Ticket submitted on behalf of startup PI.  Chris Hempel


I intend to do some GPU related research on large linear solver, so I choose comet GPU cluster as my primary resources. However, it is my first time to log in to comet, how can I setup my user name and password at comet? Thanks!

Best Regards,
Chong
