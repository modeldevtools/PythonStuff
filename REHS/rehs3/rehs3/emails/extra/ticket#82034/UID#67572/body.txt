I have been able to use the SUs awarded for the regular Comet queue, although I found one aspect of the queuing system somewhat limiting. On this machine, I note that the system estimates a job's anticipated SU usage based on its resource request and does not allow a job to enter the queue that would overdraw the available allocation. While I see the reasoning behind this, I would say it definitely hampered me using my startup due to a delay in information update. For example, I submitted an initial job chain, but after the first job ran, I realized I had slightly underestimated the time required for the job to complete and wanted to update the time requested for other jobs in the chain; however, when I canceled the chain of dependent jobs, I was not able to queue up their replacements until sometime later because the system thought I had too much resource request in queue already. I struggled with this more as my allocation funds got lower and I had to queue up shorter and s
 horter jobs to fit into the remaining allocation. I don't suspect this would be a problem if one had a larger pool of SUs, but it was a challenge for efficiently utilizing a startup. Just some feedback.
