Dear all,



I have a question regarding the charging on COMET GPUs P100, since it is not clear to me from the website (http://www.sdsc.edu/support/user_guides/comet.html).

It is always true on CPU nodes that:



1 SU = 1 core x 1 hour



On the K80 GPUs, one has to consider that 1 GPU = 6 cores. This means that 6*24 = 144 SUs per 24 hours.

This means that if my code performs 25.72 ns/day, this corresponds to: 144/25.72 = 5.6 SU per 1 ns.



On the P100 GPUs, 1 GPU = 7 cores. As such, 7*24 = 168 SUs per 24 hours.

Having my code performing 25.72 ns/day, this corresponds to: 168/25.72 = 6.5 SU per 1 ns.



Is this correct? I have some questions regarding it:



1. Can I take this number as it is and multiply for the numbers of ns I want?

Or shell I apply some multiplication, considering that I am not using the entire node?



2. On the website is reported that "A P100 gpu/gpu-shared job will be charged a premium  of 1.5x‚Äù

What does it mean? Shell I increase the obtained SU per 1 ns (6.5) of the 50 % ??





Can you please clarify how shell we compute the requested SUs?





Thank you very much



Giulia
