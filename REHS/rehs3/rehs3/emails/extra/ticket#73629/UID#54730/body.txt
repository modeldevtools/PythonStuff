Hi

I recently started using the comet server (username: gkandoi) for the
research project ios117. Is it common for the server to hang up for few
seconds every few minutes or is there a problem at my end?

I would like to process ~700 mouse RNA-Seq datasets (100million to 2
billion reads; read length >= 50) using STAR and StringTie as the first
step in our project. Is there already a pipeline or workflow that other's
have used on comet that I can use? If not, can you suggest me what would be
the most efficient/optimal way to proceed?

Thanks
Gaurav
