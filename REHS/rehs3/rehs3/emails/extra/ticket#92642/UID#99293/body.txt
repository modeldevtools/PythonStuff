Hi, when I try to submit a gpu job to comet, I got this error. Since we just transfer some SU's from Bridges to Comet GPU last week, and the request has been approved. But I still cannot submit my jobs, I'm not sure whether I need to manually change some settings in order to run on GPU? Thanks for helping.
