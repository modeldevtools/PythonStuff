Hello! I have just been approved for 2,500 hours on Comet GPU. Very exciting! But, I have a few questions -- 
1. I am currently an allocations manager and my advisor is my PI. I will be doing all of the work on XSede, am I currently in a position to start utilizing GPU hours or do I need my PI to upgrade me in some way on XSede Portal?
2. I use Tensorflow GPU-backend, OpenCV, and Python for all of my work currently. Do you have a tutorial that goes through the process of connecting to XSede and calling upon these resources to run my code? 
3. How do I move files between my local computer and my XSede storage?

Thanks!
