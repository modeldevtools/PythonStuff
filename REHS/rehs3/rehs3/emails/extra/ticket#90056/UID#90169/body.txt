Dear sir or madam,

we would like to apply for a Startup allocation in advance of our research allocation, to test our code performance and scaling, as suggested by the XSEDE allocation guidance.
However, the Startup allocation also requires a code performance and scaling document on the machine we apply for.
We indeed have the code performance and scaling not on XSEDE but on another Cray machine. We would like if there is a way for us to test our code on XSEDE machine before we get any allocations in order to close this loop.

Thank you very much, and we will really appreciate your help.

Best regards,
Zhi Wang
