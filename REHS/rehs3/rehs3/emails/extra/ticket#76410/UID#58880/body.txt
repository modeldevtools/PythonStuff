Hi,

My name is Thanh and I have some trouble running jobs on Comet. I submitted
the jobs and they seems to be running but didn't output anything at all.
My User ID is tcphan
I currently have 2 jobs submitted and running but there is no output in
both cases. The locations to each submitted job are below:

/oasis/projects/nsf/ios114/tcphan/Fe/Carter/Curtin/Fe_8/No_H/Indentation_0K/Indent_50
/oasis/projects/nsf/ios114/tcphan/Fe/Carter/Curtin/Fe_7/With_H/Relax_300K

The submission scripts are sub_script for both jobs.

Thank you very much.

Best,

Thanh
