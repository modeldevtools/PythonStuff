Hi,

Our group will be submitting a research allocation proposal and we would like to try out Comet. Is it possible for me to get a trial account to quickly test our code on it? Currently we have a startup allocation on SuperMIC (AST170030). My XSEDE user name is amd616.

Thanks for the help,
Adam Dempsey
