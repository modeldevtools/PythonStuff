Hi XSEDE,

Me and my postdoc found a simple mistake in our forcing data that affected
our results, which we are submitting to a special issue with a submission
deadline on Jan 25.

We have 3% left on our SUs and have a pending renewal proposal.

Would you be able to double our current 3% on Comet right away so we can
correct our mistake?

We would greatly appreciate it.

Thank you,
Anna
