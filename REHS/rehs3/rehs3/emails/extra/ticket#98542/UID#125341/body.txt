I teach a course in computational chemistry that uses XSEDE. I would like to request a 5 node GPU allocation for Thursday, 11/8 from 11am to 12:30pm eastern (8am-9:30am pacific time) so that students can run during class time and see their jobs start. We did this a few weeks back and it worked well.

Thank you!
