It seems like I have SUs available, but I can't run my job

this is my job:


#!/bin/bash
#SBATCH --job-name="cellrangercount1"
#SBATCH --output="cellrangercount1.out"
#SBATCH --partition=compute
#SBATCH --nodes=4
#SBATCH --ntasks-per-node=24
#SBATCH --export=ALL
#SBATCH -t 00:30:00

export PATH=~/cellranger-3.0.0:$PATH
cellranger count --id=BS1 \
        --transcriptome=~/10XCionaGenome \
        --fastqs=~/scratch/181121_K00180_0718_BH2JYNBBXY_PE10x_Combo/BS1/ \
        --expect-cells=6000


Can you help me figure out what the problem is?
