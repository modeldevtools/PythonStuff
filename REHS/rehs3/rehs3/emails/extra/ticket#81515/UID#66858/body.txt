Hello, This is Bangtian Liu, a second-year PhD student at Rutgers.

I am confused about job charging policy on comet gpu. For example, 1 hour CPU-GPU hybrid task includes 50 mintues serial task on CPU and 10 mintues on K80 CPU.  So it should be 5/6 +1/6*6 SU or just 1*6 SUs. 

I am looking forward to helpful replies as soon as possible.

Best regards,
Bangtian Liu
