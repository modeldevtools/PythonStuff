Hi there,


It looks like I have not been added to the new allocation resources for the current quarter which began on July 01, 2018, even though the XSEDE page indicates that I have been added. By doing a simple "show_accounts" command via the terminal, I am not able to see the project name and so cannot run jobs on the Comet machine.


Could you look into this, please?


Thanks,

Ayo
