Hello, to someone who may concern

How's your Thanks Giving Week?

This is Jiajie Xu from University of Georgia. I am working under Dr. Paul Xie's Computational Drug Discovery Laboratory. Currently, I want to use the super computer from XSEDE to speed up my simulation. I have registered my account on the web. My question is how can I use free 1000 hours computational time? Can you send me a link to follow?


Have a good day!

Jiajie Xu
