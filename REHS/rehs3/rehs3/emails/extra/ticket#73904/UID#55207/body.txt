[System: Comet]
[Category: Allocations]
Hi Nicole,

I am following up previous request from our ABCD project for COMET use, as ticket created by Hauke. We realized that there are some misunderstanding in terms of the usage. We thought that VC is a part of the project we proposed but not exclusive. We have proposed two projects, both contain specific COMET allocation, nodes, computation time. One project is aiming to use VC, but not exclusively while the other is using COMET through ssh with sun grid job control without constraint to VC. Since we cannot query the project resource from XSEDE, it becomes a great trouble to coordinate. Meanwhile, we also realized VC cannot fulfill our current need right now, so we plan to focus on the COMET through ssh. Can you help us to sort this out? 

Here I CCed to Feng and Hauke, who were sending requests previously.

Thanks,

Best,
Chun
