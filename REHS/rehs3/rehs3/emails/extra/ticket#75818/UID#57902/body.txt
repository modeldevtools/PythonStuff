Dear Staff at XSEDE,

Our request for computing time was just approved and awarded. A notification letter was received one week ago. However, we still cannot use it now. I noticed that the starting time is Oct-1-2017.
However,  I am wondering whether it is possbile to use these awarded time now to avoide delay in our research calculations. Thanks for your consideration. 

Sincerely,
Kesong YANG
