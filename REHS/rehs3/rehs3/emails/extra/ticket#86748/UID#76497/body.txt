Hi, 

I am a postdoctoral scholar in Prof. David Mobley's lab at UC Irvine. I would like to apply for a startup allocation on Comet GPU (at SDSC) to test a new protocol for protein-ligand binding pose prediction. Attaching my proposal and CV for the same.

Please let me know if any additional information is needed.

Thanks,
Sukanya
