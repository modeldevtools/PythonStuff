Dear admin.,
With reference to my earlier ticket (#77885) and the suggestion for a trial account on Comet (while I await for my account to become active), I would like to request for such temporary access on Comet to test out the import and installation of my CFD code that I wish to eventually run on Stampede (through my PIs allocation). My XSEDE-portal username is sutirtha.
Anticipating your kind understanding and approval,
Thanking you,
Best regards,
Sutirtha.
