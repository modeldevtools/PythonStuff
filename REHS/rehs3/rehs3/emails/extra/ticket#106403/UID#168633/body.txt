Hi Mahi,
I am trying to develop a better management strategy on the group usage of our allocation, but I am not able to view each user's quota.  Is there another command I can use other than the following to see each member of sio124?
lfs quota -h -g sio124 /oasis/projects/nsf

If I use -u username, I'm forbidden from seeing anyone else's storage but my own.  If I don't have access, can you provide me with the current breakdown?
