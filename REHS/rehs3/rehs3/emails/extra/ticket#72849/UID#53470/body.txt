Hi.

I have a trial account, username lflo, I'm installing the CP2K code on it
and have to run several tests, regstest, before performing any real
simulation.

There are some supercomputer centers that requires users use an interactive
session when compiling codes. Is it the case of XSEDE? I looked for help on
the website but didn't find anything.

Also, I'm looking on the user portal and it seems that I have 1 SU, could
you confirm that, please?
