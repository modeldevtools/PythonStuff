Hi

I am Varun Syal, enrolled in the PHYS-244 class that is taught by Prof. Michael
Norman. I wish to reserve a dedicated GPU node on Comet for training a Pytorch
model on multiple GPUs. Will it be possible to get a reservation for 12-24
hours?I particularly need a long time reservation, and may wait for a suitable
time slot, as I'm not able to get that directly.
My username is vsyal
