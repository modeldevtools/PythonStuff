Hello,
I have a teaching allocation on Comet (CHE170071), however the jobs my students submitted on Wednesday are still queued. I was under the impression that our jobs have high priority, so I wanted to check if there is anything we should change for our submission process. Some of the example users whose jobs have not started are:
franz92
sidlalla
shuwu

Thank you,

Chantal
