Hi, Marty,

I am spending a lot of time trying to use my SUs wisely, but I seem to be
unable to get the calculations that you and I agreed on to match my usage.
For example, about two weeks ago I ran a simulation for 10 hours on 720
processors.  I thought that you and I agreed that such a simulation would
"cost" about 7,000 SUs.  My usage, however, never showed a 7,000 SU peak.

I have read both the Comet user guide on the technical details of Comet.
It seems that the words core and processor -- at some level -- are
synonymous.

I have also read Sterling's HPC textbook in order to understand this SU
expenditure.

Yesterday, I ran for 15 hours on 720 and got lots of data, but didn't get
as far -- number of steps -- as I needed to see the sub-structure of the
disk galaxy.

What happens if I just run over my allotment?  I suppose that it depends on
how seriously. Given the order of my mis-calculations I could end up doing
something really wrong with Comet.

I have also downloaded my csv file of usage and it's shocking because I do
not see usage for simulations for which I have data.  The csv file,
however, agrees with all the rest of the information from XSEDE, i.e. that
my usage is very low.

The idea that I am computing SUs completely incorrectly occurred to me:
perhaps one SU is using one node for an hour.  Then the numbers would work
out, but it seems completely wrong in terms the Comet user guide.

Best,

johnny
