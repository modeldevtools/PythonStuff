Hello,

The graduate student working on my project, Brett Morris, has been running lots of jobs on the OSG as part of our start up allocation.    We have adapted our program to run for the OSG recommended duration of a 4 hour wall-time.  We have run a series of at least 10,000 condor jobs with wall-times of exactly 4 hour  as part of our project.  Which we expected to be half of our allocated 100,000 startup on the OSG.  However, when I look at our usage, it says that we have only used 3022 SUs on the OSG.    How much wall-time counts for an SU on the OSG?  Looking at the documentation on the documentation on the meaning of an SU,  https://portal.xsede.org/knowledge-base/-/kb/document/bazo , the OSG is not listed.   

Is there something wrong with how the allocation part of the MyXSEDE portal is reporting our usage?   

Any information you have to tell us how close we are to running out of our allocation will be helpful.  

Thanks,
Leslie Hebb
