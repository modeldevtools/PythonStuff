Hello, 

We currently have a little over 420,000 SUs available on Comet. But, when I was trying to submit a job today, I received an error message that no allocation is available because the running/queued jobs from our group already requires 416,052 SUs. 
There are currently not many jobs running or queued from our group members that requires that much of time. I would appreciate if you could check this out. 

Thank you,
Salai Ammal
