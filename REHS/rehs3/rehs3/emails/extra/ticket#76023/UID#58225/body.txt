Hi

We have allocations in comet (Multidimensional Modeling of NOx Formation in High Hydrogen Content Fuels Combustion in Gas Turbine Applications | TG-CTS170024) where all the SUs were used. We applied for supplement SUs of 40000 and got approved. But this was approved as a new account shown in the XSEDE portal as Comet GPU, Active/Supplement, whereas all the 60000 SUs before were in a different account shown as Comet (active/new). We have all the necessary software installed in the previous account.

The question is, can we use this is new allocation in a new account to cases using those already compiled softwares? If not, what should I do to run them in the new account?
