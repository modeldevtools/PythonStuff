This is Ivan Raikov from the Soltesz lab. Thank you very much for reaching out to us. We actually do have an issue that perhaps you could help us resolve. We have currently used up almost 80% of our yearly XSEDE allocation on Comet, partly due to the fact that we received less than the requested SUs, and due to the fact that development of our simulation code is progressing quite rapidly. We were wondering if it might be possible to obtain additional SUs closer to the amount we originally requested, as Comet is quite a valuable resource for our research.  Thank you very much for your assistance with this matter. Best regards,

-Ivan Raikov
