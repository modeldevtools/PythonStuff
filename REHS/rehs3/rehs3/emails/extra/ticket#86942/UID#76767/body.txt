Hi, on this site https://portal.xsede.org/allocations/research it states that there are 800,000 comet GPU hours available for the upcoming quarterly XRAC meeting. Is this up to date?
Also we understand (from the comet user guide) that 1 GPU hour (1 SU) on comet gpu resources is the use of 1GPU (K80) for 1hour?
Is this correct?
Thanks,
Travis
