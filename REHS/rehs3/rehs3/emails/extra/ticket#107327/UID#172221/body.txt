Hello,
My gromacs jobs on COMET are terminating due to disk space error. As far as I can tell, I am in the correct directory in the nsf file system. My working directory is 
/oasis/projects/nsf/wag101/aksharma/md-simulations/sims-CaCl2/w0-20-0.25M-CaCl2/run-1

The file error*.out has the following message: 

Fatal error:
XTC error - maybe you are out of disk space?

This has happened on multiple different nodes. I am not sure what I am doing wrong. Could you please look into this.

Thanks a lot,
Arun
