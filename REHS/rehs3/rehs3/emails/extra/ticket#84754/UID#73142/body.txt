I am graduating with my Ph.D. degree in April. I have to review some of my couple cluster single point energy calculation before I submit my dissertation to the committee. Would you please assign some time for me in a comet. I have been using comet with PI Dr. Marat Talipov and he has already submitted the proposal.But I need some resources in urgent.
