Hi,

I am running an experiment to measure the communication time between nodes in for an algorithm. What concerns me is that how the nodes are assigned when I submit a job? to be specific, I submit a job with two nodes and measure the communication time between them. Is the distance between these nodes always the same? Are the on the same rack or there might be on different racks? If so, is there any way to fix those nodes so the communication time stays the same?

Thanks,
Saeed
