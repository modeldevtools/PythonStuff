Hello,

      Last week on Friday, I added user sallec to my xsede allocation (ucr126); however, today she mentioned that the ucr126 allocation still shows ineligible when she types show_accounts at the Linux prompt.

       Is there something wrong with adding her to the allocation?

Thanks,
Prof. Wong
