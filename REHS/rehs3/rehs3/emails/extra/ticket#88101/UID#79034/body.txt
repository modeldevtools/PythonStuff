Hello,

I’m a graduate student in Gene Yeo’s lab here at UCSD and we were unsure if our lab has an allocation for resources on Comet. We previously had someone (Alain Domissy) who applied for resources for our lab, but he has since moved on to a different job and so we were uncertain what the result of the allocation proposal was.

If it so happens that we do have an allocation for Comet resources, would this allocation include use of Comet’s NVIDIA Pascal P100 GPU Nodes?

Thanks,
Noorsher Ahmed
