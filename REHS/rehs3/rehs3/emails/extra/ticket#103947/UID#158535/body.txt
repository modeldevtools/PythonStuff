Dear XSEDE team,

I've successfully deployed all of my code in COMET and for the most part
I've had a very smooth experience. However, I've now encountered the
following sbatch error (or similar) in some submissions:

sbatch: error: bank_limit plugin: The requested time can not exceed the
available balance.
Requested SUs: 145
Allocation limit group SUs: 50000
Allocation limit user SUs: 50000
Allocation used group SUs: 7084
Allocation used user SUs: 7084
Allocation available group SUs: 42916
Allocation available user SUs: 42916
Allocation running/queued group SUs: 42775
Allocation running/queued user SUs: 42775
Allocation completed today group SUs: 3
Allocation completed today user SUs: 3
sbatch: error: Batch job submission failed: Requested time limit is invalid
(missing or exceeds some limit)


It looks like this only occurs when I have multiple jobs queued and/or
running (about 150, I think), but I couldn't find such restriction in the
documentation.

Looking around I saw this report that seems somewhat related:
https://github.com/marbl/canu/issues/1164
In there, they report adding '-p shared' to the sbatch solves the problem,
but I'm not sure what's the reason behind that (or if that'd actually work).


Thanks a lot!
Miguel (XSEDE User: lrr).
