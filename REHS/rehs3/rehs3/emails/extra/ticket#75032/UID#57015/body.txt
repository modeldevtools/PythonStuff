Hello,

I am now trying to run my program on comet by using MATLAB. Due to the dimension of the dataset and the optimization algorithm, it would probably need 128G to run my program. Is it possible for me to request 1 shared nodes with 128G memory request. Or the only solution is to use the large-shared node?


Best,

Shengnan
