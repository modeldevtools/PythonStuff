To whom it concerns,

I submitted some computations yesterday on a gpu-share allocation on SDSC
Comet, and checking this morning it looks like the jobs are frozen. When I
run

squeue -u kottkech

my output is always

JOBID PARTITION     NAME     USER ST       TIME  NODES NODELIST(REASON)
22323313 gpu-share slurm4.s kottkech CG       0:04      1 comet-34-18
22323311 gpu-share slurm2.s kottkech CG       0:06      1 comet-34-18
22323312 gpu-share slurm3.s kottkech CG       0:06      1 comet-34-18

In general these jobs take 4.5 hours to complete, but they appear stuck at
4 to 6 seconds. I tried to kill or suspend these jobs, but I was unable to
kill them as they had already started running, and I wasn't able to suspend
them as I got a permission denied error.

Do you have any insight into what might have happened and how I can remove
these jobs from the queue if they are not behaving normally. Additionally,
will my SUs be charged for the frozen time? I've run hundreds of these jobs
before with no issue, so this is new to me.

Thank you,
~Chris
