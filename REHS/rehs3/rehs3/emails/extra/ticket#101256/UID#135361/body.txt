Hello,

I am trying to submit a job to Comet, but get this error message:

sbatch: error: bank_limit plugin: The requested time can not exceed the
available balance.
Requested SUs: 9
Allocation limit group SUs: 50000
Allocation limit user SUs: 50000
Allocation used group SUs: 15664
Allocation used user SUs: 6535
Allocation available group SUs: 34336
Allocation available user SUs: 43465
Allocation running/queued group SUs: 0
Allocation running/queued user SUs: 0
Allocation completed today group SUs: 39811
Allocation completed today user SUs: 0
sbatch: error: Batch job submission failed: Requested time limit is invalid
(missing or exceeds some limit)

I have tried requesting different values for the time limit, from 1 minute
to 20 hours, but I still get this error.

This is my group's allocation id: TG-PHY180002. The allocation website
shows that 15k/50k has been used. Is there something I am missing? Thanks.

Best,
Majid.
