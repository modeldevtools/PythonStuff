Hi all,



I have been working on benchmarking some amber simulations, I’ve gotta expected scaling results on CPUs but the GPU test I ran gave me very slow results. I tried starting with just 1 GPU but was getting timings around 9.8 ns/day on the P100 nodes and 5.9 on the k80 node. I’ve attached my input files and slurm submission along with the error and mdinfo files. 



Thank you,

Sarah
