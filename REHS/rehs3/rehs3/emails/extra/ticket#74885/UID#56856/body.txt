Ticket submitted on behalf of user/PI, assigned to SDSC.  Chris Hempel

Our research proposal was approved for the allocation period that began on 7/1/2017. We requested only Comet-GPU not knowing that there are now two Comet resources. We would really also like some allocation on Comet, would it be possible for us to submit a supplement for allocation on Comet at this point?

I discussed this with Chris Hempel who suggested a discussion with SDSC staff to see if a supplement request could be considered.
