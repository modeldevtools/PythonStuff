 Ticket <URL: https://tickets.xsede.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=79159 >


Could you let us know whether it is possible to use Docker
(https://www.docker.com/) and if so how? Our research is somewhat
time-critical. 

 

We have a Comet allocation but it seems there is no docker installed on this
cluster. Are there any XSEDE clusters which have docker installed? If not,
could we install docker? How?

 

Thank you!

 

Best regards,

 

Sebastian

Hello, 

We are trying to determine whether it will be possible to run our
Docker-based application on XSEDE. The architecture includes a master node,
which we would host on AWS (since it has a persistent database), and worker
nodes. Worker nodes take compute tasks from the master node, and return
results to the master node. Each worker node is provisioned with Docker, and
runs several Docker containers. Are there any XSEDE clusters which have
docker installed? If not, could we install docker?

Thanks!
-Peter
