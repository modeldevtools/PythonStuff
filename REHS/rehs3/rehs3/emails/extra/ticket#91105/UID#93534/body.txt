Lectori salutem,

I have spoken to Mahidhar from the Comet cluster for I wanted to gain
access to the cluster (ticket ref #91007).
I am a graduate student computer engineer at Erasmus Medical Center and my
goal is to develop a multi GPU / multi node implementation of our brain
simulator: http://erasmusbrainproject.com/index.php/themes/brainframe.
Unfortunately the Comet can not gain me access directly. Would it be
possible - if you were to support my cause - to grant me some of the NSG
allocation time?
If there are any questions whatsoever I would be very happy to answer them.

Kind regards,
Michiel.
