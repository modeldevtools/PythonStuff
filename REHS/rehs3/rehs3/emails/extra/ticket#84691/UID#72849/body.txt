Dear Xsede Service,

I have noticed that, in the allocation/usage, we have 2300 SUs (2300 G) available in storage and nothing is stored (see attachment). In fact, we have stored 32G data. Why does it show '0'?

Furthermore, as I initiate new runs, they are terminated due to the exceeded quota. Why? We should have lots of space not been used.

I would greatly appreciate if you could clarify these questions. 

Best,
Han
