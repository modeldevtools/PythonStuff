[Ticket created from XUP by amentes]
[From: Ahmet Mentes]
[System: Comet]
[Category: Allocations]
Hi There,

Are there any available benchmark calculations of NAMD molecular dynamics simulations, typically for around 200K atoms system or so, using GPU nodes on Comet? If there are, could you please share it with me so that I can re-calculate my allocation request on Comet based on GPU performance? I need this information because I have no benchmark data on Comet in order to calculate my estimated request time. 

Thank you,
Ahmet
