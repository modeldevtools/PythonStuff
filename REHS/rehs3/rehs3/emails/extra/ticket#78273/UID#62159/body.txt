Hi Help Desk,

 

I am a 3rd year CS PhD student at the University of Utah and I have been
working on tracing for debugging large-scale applications, mostly HPC.

We have a tool that efficiently records traces during the execution of
large-scale MPI applications using Pin (from Intel) instrumentation
framework. We want to do some evaluation and comparison of our tool versus
other similar tools. My advisors are working on a proposal for allocation on
XSESDE resources. But I wanted to test a few simple jobs of my experiments
first to see how suitable is Comet for our purposes. 

Please let me know if you have any questions or any further steps that I
have to take to get a trial account.

 

Regards,

Saeed

 

p.s: I have issued a ticket through XTS but it seems that it did not get
through (in case you get duplicate requests)
