Hello,

I am administering the XSEDE accounts for a group that has recently stopped using XSEDE resources (allocation expired Dec. 31, 2017 with no intention for submitting a renewal).

I would like to find all the clusters on which users in my group have data. Ideally, I'd also like to be able to scp/globus that data out to our local repository without bothering all the users (some of whom have moved away), so I guess that means I'm asking if it is possible for me to run chmod g+rX or something similar on the directories of other users in my group?

Thank you for your help,
Chris.
