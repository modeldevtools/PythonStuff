Hello,

I have two separated questions.

1. I was submitting jobs using my start-up allocation (TG-AST180033) on Comet. I found my submitted job (ID 19491973) has been pending for a long time. When I view the job by "squeue -u wangcha", it appears PartitionDown status. Is this the common situation? Should I just wait for the job to run?

2. Our last research proposal (AST180042) was rejected, and according to the Allocations administrator comments, I can apply for a startup supplement request. How should I submit the request?

Best,
Chaoran
