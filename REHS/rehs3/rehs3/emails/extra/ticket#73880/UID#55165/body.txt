Hi,


I am currently using Matlab on XSEDE resource Comet with the help of documentation available at the "http://www.sdsc.edu/support/user_guides/tutorials/matlab.html". As per this documentation, compute node is being requested for 30 mins. But when I try with a greater value, an error is being thrown. Can you let me know how to request resource for more than 30 mins?
