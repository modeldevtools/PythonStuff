I see on the website that I can transfer an allocation between Comet (where I have an acount) and comet-gpu (where I do not currently have an account), but I don't see how to do it. I would like to move 1/3 my allocation to GPUs if possible. Can you either explain how to do this, or do the move?

Thank you,
Philip Marcus
