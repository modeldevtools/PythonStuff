Dear Help,

I'm teaching new user training at Morgan State University next week, on Tuesday, 9/25/2018, in the afternoon -
https://portal.xsede.org/group/xup/course-calendar/-/training-user/class/649/session/1683

I'd like to request a reservation for 2 nodes (shared queue), from 1pm to 5pm Eastern time, on 9/25/2018, for all of the users on TG-ASC180047, which is an educational allocation set up just for this workshop.

Thank you for your help -

Jay
