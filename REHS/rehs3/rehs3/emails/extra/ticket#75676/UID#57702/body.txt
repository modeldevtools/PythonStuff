Hello,

We earlier had an issue on Comet from our group (ios111), where the
scheduler would report the requested SUs to be around 5 million, in
contrast to the group allocation of around 1.86 million. We were unable to
submit jobs anymore and my job array (job ID 11260456) got stuck at task
288, and tasks 288-505 need to be executed further. The reason on the queue
is shown to be 'QOSMaxCpusPerUserLimit'. However I am unsure if the
scheduler issue has been addressed and if I should cancel this job and
re-run it or not.

Could you please advise me as to what I should do regarding this particular
job?

Thank you,

Regards,
Aditya Komajosula
