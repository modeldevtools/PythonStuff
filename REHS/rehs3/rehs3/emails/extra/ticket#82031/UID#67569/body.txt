I do have a question regarding my startup allocation. The notification of the award indicated that, in addition to the 50k Comet SUs I requested, I was also being awarded 1k SUs on the Comet GPU queue, but I do not see the latter listed in my portal or my "show_accounts" list on the command line. We are currently working on a NAMD compile that can take full advantage of the Comet GPU architecture, so it would be great if I could get access to this extra award for testing and code optimization going forward.
