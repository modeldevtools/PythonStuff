Hello, I have a question about SU charging on Comet GPU.  For example, I have a 1 hour task (50 mintues on CPU, and 10 mintues on GPU.) Therefore, how many SU will be charged.  As shown in the attachment, I notices this project only has 2500 SUs. I wonder whether SU charging on comet is dependent on the actual time of task running on GPU or the total job time. I am confused about how to compute SU charging on Comet GPU.
