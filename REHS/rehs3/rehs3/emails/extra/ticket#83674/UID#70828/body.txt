Hello,

       One of my students (username: libby0yc) accidentally charged another allocation that belongs to my collaborator.  Specifically, she charged 5345 SU hours to project ucr124 instead of to my allocation (ucr121).  Would it be possible to "refund" the 5345 hours to ucr124 and "take out" those same number of hours from my allocation (ucr121) instead?

Thanks,
Prof. Wong
