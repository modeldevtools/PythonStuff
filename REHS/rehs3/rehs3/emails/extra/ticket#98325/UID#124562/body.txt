Hello,

On comet.sdsc.edu,  I would like to transfer data to my oasis allocation (/oasis/projects/nsf/allocationname/username). From the help docs I - When I try to find my `allocationname` via `show_accounts` it fails to print any allocations. How are these allocations managed, do I need to go through my group's admin or some other way?

Thanks,
Brian
