Hi  our simulation stopped unexpectedly, and we thought it was because we had run out of allocation. Attached is a screenshot of our allocation usage. What I interpret this to mean is that almost all of the 50,0000 SUs are NOT used and most of the comet GPU is NOT usedâ€¦..or is it the other way around? does the 121/50000 mean we only have 121SUs left?
