Hi,
I have been running a couple of jobs since yesterday, each on 168 cores (7 nodes of Comet) and for 20 hours, which were both finished this morning. I am also currently running another job from my allocation TG-CTS170036 on Comet, with job ID 17788341, but when I check my allocations usage, it still shows that 0% of my allocation has been used! I was wondering what is going on here? Is anything wrong?
Thanks,
Arash
