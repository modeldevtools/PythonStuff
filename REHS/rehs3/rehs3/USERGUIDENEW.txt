classifiernb has all of the naive bayes code in it. there are instructions on how to run it in the file. it is not fully compatable with the main.py file
classifiersk has all of the scikit classifiers in it, and is also not compatible with the main.py file. it has example ways to test it out in the bottom of the file.
the training_emails directory has all of the data, and it is closer to the 2.5x increase
