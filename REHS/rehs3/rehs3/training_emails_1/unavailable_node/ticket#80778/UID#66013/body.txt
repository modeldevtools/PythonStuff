Hello,
I am trying to run my job since yesterday on Comet with no luck, every couple of hours the Job will Node_Fail and re-queued. Since we are toward the end of a year with the holidays next week and we will lose those resources, in addition to needing them urgently. Is there is any chance that those resources be transferred to Bridges?
If not, I will really appreciate solving the problem on Comet soon.
Thanks in advance,
Doaa
