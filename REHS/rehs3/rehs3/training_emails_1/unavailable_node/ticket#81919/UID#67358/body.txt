Dear XSEDE help desk,

We are trying to run a job on XSEDE comet since yesterday, but the job is not distributed to nodes.

The squeue command displays:

"(ReqNodeNotAvail, UnavailableNodes:comet-01-[01-72],comet-04-49,comet-06-43,comet-07-16,comet-12-58,comet-14-[57-60],comet-16-67,comet-22-[10,46],comet-23-[63,66],comet-25-[21-24],comet-29-56,comet-30-03,comet-
31-20)"

There seems to be a maintenance window scheduled for Tuesday. Is there any maintenance scheduled for today? 


Thank you
