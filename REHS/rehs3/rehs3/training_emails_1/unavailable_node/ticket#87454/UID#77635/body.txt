Hi,

I'm having an issue where my jobs are not running from the queue. They have been sitting there for more than 24 hours. These are single node jobs. They do request a full 48 hours, but even with this constraint the 24 hour wait seems unusual. I haven't seen any notifications of upcoming maintenance, and I don't see any other than the 4/17 maintenance in the XSEDE user news (https://portal.xsede.org/user-news). Also the queue reason listed when I run `squeue` is "Priority", not "ReqNodeNotAvailable" as I'd expect if the issue was maintenance related. My advisor (Rob Riggleman) is having the same issues, even with a shorter time request.

Is there anything we can do to get our jobs running, or is the queue just really backed up right now?

Thanks in advance for your time!
-Ben
