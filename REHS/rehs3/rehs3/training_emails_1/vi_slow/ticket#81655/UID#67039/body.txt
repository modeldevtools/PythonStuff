I use the filespace in 
/oasis/projects/nsf/mis125/iulusoy/
and 
/oasis/scratch/comet/iulusoy/temp_project/
because my jobs create many temporary files. I log on to comet using ssh via my unix console. Now if I modifiy any of the files in both of these directories using vi, the response time of comet is extremely slow. Is there a way to make this faster, or another scratch directory that I could be using? Thank you.
