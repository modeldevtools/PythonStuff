Hi Team, 

Is there any issue going on comet. Its very slow, taking long time abruptly to get the prompt back. Second I tried to run some program Sunday and today also , its shows its running but not writing any log files or dump files. This is my path, /oasis/scratch/comet/avik/temp_project/Al-Cu/SurfaceEnergy/Al2Cu-C16/100


Thanks
Avik
