Hi,

I have terrible issues with vim on comet. It is really slow and freezes at some times (for 10 to 30 seconds). Pasting a few lines and saving files can take ages. I tried to unload my setup in my .vimrc (syntax off and deleting everything else) but the problem seems to stay (maybe slightly better). Do you have any tricks to help me with this?

Thank you for your help.
