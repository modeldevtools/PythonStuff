We are trying to troubleshoot some new code, so our issues could be internal, but we have seen some long delays in inter-process communication today. Also on the login node, I noticed that sbatch and squeue were sometimes timing out. Are there some ongoing network or otherwise slowdowns today? Thank you for your help.
