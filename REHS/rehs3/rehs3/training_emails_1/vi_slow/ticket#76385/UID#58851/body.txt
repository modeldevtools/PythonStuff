Hello,

When using the /home and the /oasis/scratch/comet filesystems on Comet I am having significant delays whenever using commands such as cd or ls, or when using a text editor. I recently had similar issues and they were resolved when it was discovered that someone was overloading the filesystems. Is it possible that the same issue is happening again?

Thanks,
Adrian
