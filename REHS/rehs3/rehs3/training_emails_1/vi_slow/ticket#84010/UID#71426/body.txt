Dear TACC,

I find it is really trouble to even write in a batch script on Comet. It is alway stuck in the middle and do not respond. I usually operate in my work directory or scratch one.
Sometimes, I just want to change a variable or a path in a small submit script. 
It's been alway like that slow, I don't understand why the host node can be so slow. 
It brings so much inconvenience in preparing a job to run.

Can you help?
Many thanks.

Chenyi
