Hi, Recently I have been facing some issues editing my code on comet. Before recovering a simulation from a checkpoint, I often need to modify the parameters of my simulation and hence, have to edit the files. However, whenever I try to do that, the editing software (I use vim) often freezes. Could you please suggest a solution?

Also, I am trying to debug one of my simulations and hence need to run it for few iterations. Adding it on normal queue takes a lot of waiting time. Is there a test queue where I can debug this more quickly? If yes, what is the name of this queue?

Thanks,
Bhavesh Khamesra
