I loaded cp2k/4.1 module and requested 4 nodes and 24 cores/node.  It was fine with running an input file with ~64 atoms.  When I increased the number of atoms to ~200, the program would run but hang before it started the first iteration.  I waited for 10 minutes (two different times) and it still hung.  I noticed that the default module was with mvapich_ib which I never used before.
I used the same input file to run at a local hpcc (intel/15.0, intel mpi/5.0.1, fftw/3.3.4) it only took 2 seconds to see the first iteration.
