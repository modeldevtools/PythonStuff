[System: Comet]
[Category: Batch Queues/Jobs]
Hello,
I am trying to submit the job sim-analysis-new.sh in directory /oasis/scratch/comet/annat/temp-project/g685d however I get the following error: 

sbatch: error: bank_limit plugin: user is disallowed to submit jobs
sbatch: error: Batch job submission failed: Invalid account or account/partition combination specified

The account I am using shows that there is renewed time on Comet. Could you please help me identify the error in the job script?

Thank you.
