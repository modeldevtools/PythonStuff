Dear Help,

I would like to run a model under partition cla147. I couldn't.
I have my user permission on this account activated by Lionel Renault (PI).

sbatch Launch_roms_1997_1_1.cmd
sbatch: error: bank_limit plugin: user is disallowed to submit jobs
sbatch: error: Batch job submission failed: Invalid account or
account/partition combination specified

Thanks for your help.
Faycal
