[Ticket created from XUP by xl685]
[From: Xingchen Liu]
[System: Comet]
[Category: Allocations]
Hello,

I have question about the remaining allocation in our group.
After logging in on the xsede website, it shows "Allocation Resources
Remaining: 46577.0 of 220382.0 SUs"

However, when I tried to submit jobs on Comet today, a message on the terminal shows:
sbatch: error: bank_limit plugin: user is disallowed to submit jobs

Could you please check the actual status of our allocations?

Thank you.
