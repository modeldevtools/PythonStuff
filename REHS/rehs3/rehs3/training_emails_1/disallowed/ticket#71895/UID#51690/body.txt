I believe my resource on comet is back.
I can see it on my xsede page.
But I get the following error when I submit an interactive job.

==========

[klwong@comet-ln2 SCRIPTS]$ ./interact
srun: error: bank_limit plugin: user is disallowed to submit jobs
srun: error: Unable to allocate resources: Invalid account or account/partition combination specified


[klwong@comet-ln2 SCRIPTS]$ more interact
srun -A TG-ASC170031 --partition=debug --pty --nodes=1 --ntasks-per-node=24 -t 00:30:00 --wait=0 --export=ALL /bin/bash


======


Many thanks,

Kwai Wong
