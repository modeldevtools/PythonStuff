Dear XSEDE Admin,

We have been using COMET cluster for the last 6-7 months. My user name is
*kghatak. *We have been assigned to a new project code
TG-DMR180013. Prof. Dibakar Datta is the PI of the project.
We have been experiencing one problem while submitting our jobs (CPU)
stating " user in disallowed to submit jobs".  Even though we were awarded
the computing facility 4 days back, we are still unable to use it.
 Please find attached the screenshot of the error message. I, kindly
request you to help us regarding this.
Thanks,


--
