I know that our group is running low on gpu su's, however we recently requested a project extension and I'm not sure if there is an issue with the project extention or if we are out of gpu su's. I keep getting errors when I attempt to submit a job:

sbatch: error: bank_limit plugin: user is disallowed to submit jobs

sbatch: error: Batch job submission failed: Invalid account or account/partition combination specified



Is there a command line "show accounts" that will give a real time amount of gpu su's?


Thanks,
