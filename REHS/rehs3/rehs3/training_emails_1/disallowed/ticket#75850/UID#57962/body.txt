Hi,

I recently was awarded a research allocation on comet's GPU resources, but am having trouble submitting jobs. During my trial allocation the following command would work fine for me:

$ sbatch -vvv mySlurmFile.slurm

where the slurm file would be something like:
"
#!/bin/bash
#SBATCH --partition=gpu
#SBATCH --gres=gpu:k80:1
#SBATCH --ntasks-per-node=6
#SBATCH -t 01:00:00
#SBATCH --nodes=1
#SBATCH -o cometTest.out
#SBATCH -e cometTest.err
#SBATCH -J cometTest
module load cuda/8.0

/home/dsussman/cellGPU/bidisperseRescaled.out 
"

Using this process I was able to get the timing data used for the research proposal, etc. etc.

Now, however, if I do exactly the same thing, I get the following error messages:
sbatch: error: bank_limit plugin: user is disallowed to submit jobs
sbatch: error: Batch job submission failed: Invalid account or account/partition combination specified

Is there something simple that I am doing wrong? Thanks for your help!
Best,
Daniel
