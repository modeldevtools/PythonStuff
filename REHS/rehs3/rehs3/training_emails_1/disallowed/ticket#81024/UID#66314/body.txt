Hi Mahidhar,

Our group member Mahdi told me that he is disallowed to submit jobs in his Comet account (account name: mamachra), though I had added him into our group project(TG-DMR150014) for quite a long time.
 
Running "show_accounts," says the following the info. 

ID name      project      used     available    used_by_proj
------------------------------------------------------------
mamachra     csd450       0        796020       456703   (ineligible)


Could you pls help us look into this?

Thanks,
Zhenbin
