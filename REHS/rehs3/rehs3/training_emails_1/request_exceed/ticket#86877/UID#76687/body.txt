Hi,

We have a program that we developed in our group that runs on a single CPU. How can we write a submission script that will do the following:

- allocate an entire node
- run a different instance of the code on each core in this node

For instance, if a node has 28 cores, there will be 28 processes that run the same program that utilizes one core each. How can we achieve this?

Best,
Irem
