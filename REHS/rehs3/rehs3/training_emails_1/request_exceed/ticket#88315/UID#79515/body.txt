[Ticket created from XUP by chunrui]
[From: Chunrui Zou]
[System: Comet]
[Category: Allocations]
Hi Sir/Madam,

The system warned me I have exceeded the allocation as follows:

Allocation limit group SUs: 165895
Allocation limit user SUs: 165895
Allocation used group SUs: 154263
Allocation used user SUs: 85905
Allocation available group SUs: 11632
Allocation available user SUs: 79990

I cannot submit a job with SUs bigger than the "Allocation available group SUs" 11632. The "Allocation available user SUS " is 79990. Why can't I use the "Allocation available users SUs"? If I can, how can I access the resource?

Thanks for your help.
