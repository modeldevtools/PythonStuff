Hi,

Last week I ran a single performance-analysis experiment that consisted of varying several parameters over 25 jobs, and whose entire computational requirements were <4000SUs. 

Unfortunately, the first evening, I ran the script from the parent directory, as opposed to the child directory, and it was not until morning that I realized I had made the mistake.

As a result, all 25 jobs of the single experiment had been running for 15 hours each and I had expended a total of 6,945 SUs with absolutely no results. It appeared that I had just reserved a lot of computing capacity without having actually done any computation.

This is a fairly large blow to my lab's project, and I was wondering if there was any possible way to be able to get those wasted SUs back so that we can do the experiments that matter.

Any help is greatly appreciated.

Sincerely,
Stephen

Here are the IDs for the wasted jobs:
