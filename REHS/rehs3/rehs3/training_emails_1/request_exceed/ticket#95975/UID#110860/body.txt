Hello,

Could you tell me how many allocations do I have at the current time?
The website show remaining allocations with some delay in time. 
I am trying to run a job, but I have this message:
"sbatch: error: Batch job submission failed: Requested time limit is invalid (missing or exceeds some limit)"

Can you tell me how much allocations do I have now?

Thanks,
Natalia Karimova
