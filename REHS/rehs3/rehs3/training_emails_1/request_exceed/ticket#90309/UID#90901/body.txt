Hello,

I am unable to submit batch jobs for allocation TG-MCB140228 on Comet. According to xdusage we have 672,843 SUs remaining. As a test I submitted a job with a 1 second wall time limit. This submission failed with the following response:

sbatch: error: bank_limit plugin: The requested time can not exceed the available balance.
Requested SUs: 1
Allocation limit group SUs: 857519
Allocation limit user SUs: 857519
Allocation used group SUs: 197245
Allocation used user SUs: 64465
Allocation available group SUs: 660274
Allocation available user SUs: 793054
Allocation running/queued group SUs: 1888656
Allocation running/queued user SUs: 0
Allocation completed today group SUs: 30
Allocation completed today user SUs: 0
sbatch: error: Batch job submission failed: Requested time limit is invalid (missing or exceeds some limit)

Members of our research group have encountered this problem intermittently over the past few months.

Thanks you
