Hi,

I want to run Gromacs scaling tests on SuperMIC for a system containing 28840 atoms in a 7.2*7.2*7.2 nm3 box. I can run it with 24 cores and 48 cores, but when I run it with more cores (e.g., 72 or 96 cores), it got the erreors as follows. It seems there is some limition of my account. Can you delete these limitions? Moreover, I belong to two projects on SuperMIC. One is an educational allocation, the other one is Campus Champion Allocation. How to switch these two projects? I guess maybe there is some limition of educational account, but how can I switch to the other project? Thank you so much! 

errors:
sbatch: error: bank_limit plugin: The requested time can not exceed the available balance.
