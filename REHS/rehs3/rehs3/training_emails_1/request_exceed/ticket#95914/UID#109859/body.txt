To whom it may concern,
      Our group submitted a Supplement request on August 21 (PHY130003). 
Since it has been five weeks since our submission, we are writing to 
inquire about the status of our request and when we may expect the 
decision from the XSEDE Research.
      Thank you very much.
      Best regards.
