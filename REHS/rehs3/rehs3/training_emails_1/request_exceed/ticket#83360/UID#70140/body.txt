Hi,

I am a user of Comet. My batch file is

#!/bin/bash
#SBATCH --job-name="3D-d3"
#SBATCH --output="3D-d3"
#SBATCH --partition=compute
#SBATCH --nodes=1
#SBATCH --export=ALL
#SBATCH --ntasks-per-node=24
#SBATCH -L abaqus:24
#SBATCH -t 48:00:00
module load abaqus/6.14-1
export EXE=`which abq6141`
$EXE job=3D-d3 input=3D-d3.inp scratch=/scratch/$USER/$SLURM_JOBID cpus=24 mp_mode=threads memory=360000mb interactive

When submitting it, I got a message saying "Requested time limit is invalid (missing or exceeds some limit)". Could you help check it?
