Marty,

I tried to follow the Portal's description on removing Malthouse as a user,
but the instruction didn't exactly match my user page.

My research allocation request is underway, but I don't think that I am
going to make the deadline for this round.  There is a lot that I need to
learn about the code performance section.

Best,

johnny
