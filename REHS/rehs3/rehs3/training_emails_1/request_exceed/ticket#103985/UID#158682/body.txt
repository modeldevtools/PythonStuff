I checked the usage of our allocation by single user. When I check the use of our allocation by my postdoc, Hadi Dinpajooh, the system responds "no data to display". I would like to check his usage of the allocation. He is also the user that most heavily is using the allocation. How can I access that information?

Thank you.
