Dear All,

I am trying to get an estimate for my future need on comet and comet GPU to run molecular dynamic simulations using gromacs and thought to run it by you to make sure that my calculations are correct:
comet: for each job I need 8 nodes (24 core each) and I run it for total of 800 hours so the estimated SU will be 8(nodes)*24(core per node)*800=153600 SUs

comet GPU: for 1 job on K80 I need 8 GPUs (2 nodes) and the job runs for total of 192 hours. Since each K80 is charges as 1/4 of a node then the estimated SU is:
2*24*192=9216 SUs

Please let me know if these values are calculated correctly. 

Thank you for your help.
