Hello,

My group (allocation TG-CTS110007) is not able to submit jobs to Comet due
to the batch system incorrectly claiming we have queued more than our
allocation of SUs.

A user in my group (adityak) submitted a job which is a job array of size
506. Each job is 1 node/24 processes/4 hour walltime, so the entire job
array works out to be around 50,000 SUs. This job array submitted and ran
fine, but subsequent sbatch submissions (for small jobs) give an error like
this:

$ sbatch run.sh
sbatch: error: bank_limit plugin: The requested time can not exceed the
available balance.
Requested SUs: 9
Allocation limit group SUs: 1862358
Allocation limit user SUs: 1862358
Allocation used group SUs: 1188506
Allocation used user SUs: 29
Allocation available group SUs: 673852
Allocation available user SUs: 1862329
Allocation running/queued group SUs: 3002538
Allocation running/queued user SUs: 0
Allocation completed today group SUs: 28264
Allocation completed today user SUs: 0
sbatch: error: Batch job submission failed: Requested time limit is invalid
(missing or exceeds some limit)

The scheduler reports that we've queued 3 million SUs (which is more than
our entire allocation), which is not true - we requested less than 50,000.
This was caught about halfway into the job array's run time, hence the
"completed today group" value - which looks correct, it's about half of
50,000.

The number of queued SUs is decreasing as the job array completes, so this
problem will probably resolve itself soon - but we intend to use job arrays
again in the future, and it's a problem if a job array blocks the rest of
our group from getting work done on Comet. Could you please look into why
with the scheduler's reports of the total SUs requested by the group far
exceeds the actual SUs requested?

Thanks,
Alec Lofquist
