Hi,

  I submitted some jobs to the gpu-shared queue on comet before the maintenance today (4/17). Some of them ran, while others waited for the maintenance to complete.

  Now, three of the jobs that waited for the maintenance are shown to be running:
          15551867 gpu-share                  17L-time-fac1.0    maigo  RUNNING    2:13:53 2-00:00:00      1 comet-33-05
          15551868 gpu-share                 17L-class-fac0.9    maigo  RUNNING    2:13:53 2-00:00:00      1 comet-34-02
          15551869 gpu-share                  13L-time-fac0.9    maigo  RUNNING    2:13:53 2-00:00:00      1 comet-34-06

  But I'm not seeing the expected log files. When I log on to the compute nodes (comet-33-05, etc) and execute "ps aux | grep maigo", I don't see any python processes.

  Could you look into this and see why the jobs didn't run?
