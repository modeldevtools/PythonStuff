Hello team,

I am working on running my first slurm script with singularity; however, I am receiving an error. I pretty much copied the sample slurm script that you all provided, added my project id (#SBATCH --account=ucd149), and also changed the command to he following:

time -p singularity exec tensorflow-gpu.img python3 -u  run_max_margin.py $SLURM_ARRAY_TASK_ID

To run this script, I run the following on the command line:

sbatch -t 480 --mem=4000 --array=0-971 array_jobs.sh

However, I am receiving the following error when I run it:

sbatch: error: bank_limit plugin: The requested time can not exceed the available balance.
Requested SUs: 32076
Allocation limit group SUs: 2500
Allocation limit user SUs: 2500
Allocation used group SUs: 0
Allocation used user SUs: 0
Allocation available group SUs: 2500
Allocation available user SUs: 2500
Allocation running/queued group SUs: 0
Allocation running/queued user SUs: 0
Allocation completed today group SUs: 1
Allocation completed today user SUs: 1
sbatch: error: Batch job submission failed: Requested time limit is invalid (missing or exceeds some limit)

My files are located in ~/HypothesisGeneration/er_mlp.

Thanks
