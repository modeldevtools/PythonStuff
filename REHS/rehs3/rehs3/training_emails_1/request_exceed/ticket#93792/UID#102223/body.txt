Hi,
When I try to submit a job on comet, it gives this error,
sbatch: error: bank_limit plugin: The requested time can not exceed the available balance.
Requested SUs: 9
Allocation limit group SUs: 1966142
Allocation limit user SUs: 1966142
Allocation used group SUs: 1962167
Allocation used user SUs: 2070
Allocation available group SUs: 3975
Allocation available user SUs: 1964072
Allocation running/queued group SUs: 0
Allocation running/queued user SUs: 0
Allocation completed today group SUs: 4140
Allocation completed today user SUs: 0
sbatch: error: Batch job submission failed: Requested time limit is invalid (missing or exceeds some limit)
what does that mean?
