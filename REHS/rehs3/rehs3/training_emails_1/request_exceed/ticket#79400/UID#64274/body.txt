Hi,

I'm trying to submit a job to comet but I'm unable to do so. The following error appears: 

sbatch: error: bank_limit plugin: The requested time can not exceed the available balance.
Requested SUs: 25
Allocation limit group SUs: 50000
Allocation limit user SUs: 50000
Allocation used group SUs: 16915
Allocation used user SUs: 414
Allocation available group SUs: 33085
Allocation available user SUs: 49586
Allocation running/queued group SUs: 71582911
Allocation running/queued user SUs: 71582911
Allocation completed today group SUs: 422
Allocation completed today user SUs: 163
sbatch: error: Batch job submission failed: Requested time limit is invalid (missing or exceeds some limit)


We still have some time left so I'm not sure why this is happening? Can you help?

Jolene
