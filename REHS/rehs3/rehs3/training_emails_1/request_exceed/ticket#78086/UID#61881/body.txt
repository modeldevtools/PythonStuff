Hi All,

I'm running on our startup allocation oak101, and I am requesting 48 nodes and 12 cores/node.  My runs are working fine, but appear to be billed for twice the SUs I was expecting.  For a run that takes about 2.5 hours, I appear to be using about 3K SUs instead of about 1.5K SUs.  sacct shows 1152 allocated cpus instead of 576.

       JobID    JobName  Partition    Account  AllocCPUS      State ExitCode

12299186.0        orted                oak101         47  COMPLETED      0:0

I attached a copy of my sbatch script also.  I thought maybe I was not reading my usage info correctly, or I am allocating/binding cores/threads incorrectly...

Thanks,
Murph
