Hello,

I am attempting to run a 2D classification job via the relion module already downloaded on Comet. When I run my script this is the error I get:

srun: error: bank_limit plugin: Please set job time limit
srun: error: Unable to allocate resources: Requested time limit is invalid (missing or exceeds some limit)

I specify a time limit of 2 hrs in my script. When I check my time left I get this:

 show_accounts

ID name      project      used     available    used_by_proj
------------------------------------------------------------
myfry        cit171       11       50000        50139    (ineligible)

I'm not sure why I can't run the job. Any help would be great.

Best,
Michelle
