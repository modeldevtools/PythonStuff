Hi, I'm trying to submit a job on Comet, but I'm running into the error
below - which I think does not properly reflect my remaining allocation
time.  In particular, the requested number of SUs is 66, and I have 1172
available.  Weirdly the running/queued SUs says 1137, but I am not
currently running anything!  (when I type "squeue -u jshee" nothing shows
up).

Please help!

thanks,
James
