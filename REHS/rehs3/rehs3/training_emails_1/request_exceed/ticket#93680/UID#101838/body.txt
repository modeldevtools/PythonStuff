Hi, 
From what I can see under My Xsede Resources, and My Projects, there are 1820.0 of 2500.0 SUs remaining in the allocation.  However, when I try to submit jobs I get the following error message:
 
sbatch: error: bank_limit plugin: The requested time can not exceed the available balance.
Requested SUs: 193
Allocation limit group SUs: 2500
Allocation limit user SUs: 100
Allocation used group SUs: 680
Allocation used user SUs: 35
Allocation available group SUs: 1820
Allocation available user SUs: 65
Allocation running/queued group SUs: 0
Allocation running/queued user SUs: 0
Allocation completed today group SUs: 5
Allocation completed today user SUs: 5
sbatch: error: Batch job submission failed: Requested time limit is invalid (missing or exceeds some limit)

It seems that as a user I cannot access more than 100 SUs out of the total.  Can this be remedied so that I can access the remaining allocation? There are some simulations I would very much like to perform with the remaining allocation.

Thank you,
