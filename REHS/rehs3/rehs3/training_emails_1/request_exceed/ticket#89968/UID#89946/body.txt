I am attempting to submit a job on comet (Charge #:TG-MCB130050). The job that I am attempting to complete will take 577 SUs and I have 730 left available. However, when I try to run the job, I get an error saying " Requested time limit is invalid (missing or exceeds some limit)" I should have enough time left. Am I overlooking something?
