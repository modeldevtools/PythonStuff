[System: Comet]
[Category: Allocations]
I have a 50000 SU startup allocation on Comet. I have noticed that I have burnt through most of this faster than I thought was commensurate with the jobs I was submitting. Indeed, most recently, I submitted two short jobs, which took 1.5 hours of compute time each, and which requested 1 and 2 cores. By my naive calculation, this should amount to 3*1.5=4.5 SUs, as I understand 1 SU=1 core-hour. Instead, I appear to have been charged 64 SUs. This huge discrepancy would explain why I've burnt through my time so fast despite not asking for much in the way of resources. Can you explain what is going on? Am I missing something?
