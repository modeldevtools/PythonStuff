[Ticket created from XUP by rdykstra]
[From: Ryan Dykstra]
[System: Comet]
[Category: Allocations]
We were transferred 10,000 SUs to our Comet account mda125 and it shows up as available in the XSEDE USER PORTAL  under Comet:

311142.0 / 321142.0 SUs

When I log into Comet the command show_accounts shows this:

rdykstra     mda125       25077    311142       311142

When I try to run my calculations I get an error message:

sbatch: error: bank_limit plugin: The requested time can not exceed the available balance.
 
I am assuming this error message is due to the lack of SUs on the account. How to I obtain access to the hours we transferred to Comet. 

Thanks,
