[Ticket created from XUP by zcx]
[From: chengxin zhang]
[System: Comet]
[Category: Allocations]
We are awarded 10million SU for TG-MCB160124 "Online Platform for I-TASSER-Based Structure and Function Prediction" to be used by the "zhanglab" community account for I-TASSER gateway on comet. The old allocation id was mia181. Since the award is approved, we do not see any new allocation account on comet using "show_accounts". Starting from today, our old allocation account does not allow us to submit new jobs. This means that "zhanglab" is not associated with any active allocations. I wonder when will the approve allocation be allocated in Comet, and whether we can temporary use the old allocation account for gateway job submission until then.
