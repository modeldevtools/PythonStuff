[Ticket created from XUP by abs63]
[From: Alan Shenkerman]
[System: Comet GPU]
[Category: Allocations]
Hi,

I was recently approved for a startup allocation under PI Duncan Thomas, for 2500 GPU hours on Comet-GPU. I ran our first job for 48 hours on a P100 GPU, and for some reason when I check using "show_accounts abs63 --gpu" it says I've used 289 SUs out of my 2500. I was told that SUs would correspond to GPU hours, but as of now this does not seem to be the case. At this rate, running 10 jobs on the GPU would use up the entire allocation, which we planned to be using for at least a period of months. Could you help me with this issue?
