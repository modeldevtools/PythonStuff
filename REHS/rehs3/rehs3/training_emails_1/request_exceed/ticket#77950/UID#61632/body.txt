[System: comet-gpu.sdsc.xsede]
[Category: Allocations]
I used 22 SU on a Comet startup account TG-ASC15024 to get benchmarks for my 10-10-17 XSEDE allocation request. Together with that request, I asked, and was granted 1000 SU in advance that expires 12-31-17. Thank you. That advance is reported in my MCB140208 account on the XSEDE user portal.

I tried to start a job today and got this output
sbatch: error: bank_limit plugin: The requested time can not exceed the available balance.
Requested SUs: 145
Allocation limit group SUs: 2500
Allocation limit user SUs: 100
Allocation used group SUs: 610
Allocation used user SUs: 22
Allocation available group SUs: 1890
Allocation available user SUs: 78
Allocation running/queued group SUs: 145
Allocation running/queued user SUs: 145
Allocation completed today group SUs: 0
Allocation completed today user SUs: 0
sbatch: error: Batch job submission failed: Requested time limit is invalid (missing or exceeds some limit)

The top of my sbatch job file looks like this 
#!/bin/bash
# run_upx1.sh: Run equilibrations of four upx1 models on Comet using 4 GPU's
#SBATCH -J upx1a                 # job name
#SBATCH -o %j.out                # output and error file name (%j expands to jobID)
#SBATCH --partition=gpu          # queue -- gpu or gpu-shared
#SBATCH --nodes=1                # Total number of nodes requested (24 cores/node)
#SBATCH --ntasks-per-node=24     # 6 x number of GPUs for K80 (7x for P100)
#SBATCH --no-requeue             # do not restart upon node failure
#SBATCH --gres=gpu:4             # use one GPU per model of any type
#SBATCH -t 24:00:00              # run time (hh:mm:ss) - 24 hour (max)

The benchmark jobs that I previously successfully ran now give a similar failure notice.
