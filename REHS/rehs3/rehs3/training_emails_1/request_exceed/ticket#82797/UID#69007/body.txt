Hello,

I have been processing RNA sequencing data on Comet for the past week or so. Every time I run a program (i.e. fastqc, cutadapt, STAR, etc) I have been receiving the following error in the .err file after submitting a job:


slurmstepd: Exceeded step memory limit at some point.


The path to my last run is as follows:

/home/idwivedi/temp_project/practice_project/STAR/star_alignment


The relevant files are:
star_mapping.sh

star_mapping.14028204.comet-04-49.out
