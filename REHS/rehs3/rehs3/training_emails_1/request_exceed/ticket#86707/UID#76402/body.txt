I am trying to understand why a job on my allocation required so many more SUs than normal (see attached .csv). This was a job submitted by user joel11 on my allocation on 2 April 2018 and apparently was requesting >9k SUs.


The shell file is:


#!/bin/bash
#SBATCH --job-name="dDocent"
#SBATCH --output="dDocent.%j.%N.out"
#SBATCH --partition=compute
#SBATCH --nodes=4
#SBATCH --ntasks-per-node=24
#SBATCH --export=ALL
#SBATCH --qos=oneweek
#SBATCH -t 96:00:00
export MODULEPATH=/share/apps/compute/modulefiles/applications:$MODULEPATH
module load dDocent/2.2.16
dDocent Pop2_Config.file

other similar jobs have called for many fewer SUs.

  1.  Is there a way to calculate the number of SUs a job will require before sbatching it?
  2.  Are there other ways I can estimate the number of SUs without trying to sbatching?

Thanks,
Steve
