Hi,

I recently requested to transfer a previous CPU allocation to the new GPU allocation (MCB160186), but I noticed when I do show_accounts I only see the previous allocations-

ID name      project      used     available    used_by_proj
------------------------------------------------------------
khuang8      gsu110       82057    113249       113249   (ineligible)
khuang8      gsu101       357      24000        669 

So I was wondering if the project ID that is charged in the submission script has changed at all, or do I still use the old one, even if it's listed as ineligible?

Best,

Kenneth
