To whom it may concern,
     We submitted jobs today on Comet and got the following message:

There was an error running the SLURM sbatch command.
The command was:
'/usr/bin/sbatch job.sh  2>&1'
and the output was:
'sbatch: error: bank_limit plugin: expired user, can't submit job
  sbatch: error: Batch job submission failed: Invalid account or 
account/partition combination specified
'

      However, our allocation has been renewed (TG-PHY130003).
      Do we need to change anything in our account setting or in our job 
script?
      Thank you.
