Hello,

I am using GPU on Comet cluster. I am measuring the wall-time of my jobs but I don't know exactly how can I convert the wall-time to SU. For example when I used one GPU devise and wall-time or running time was 2 hours what would be the equal SUs? or if I use 4 GPU devices for 2 hours what would be the equivalent SU.

I appreciate your helps.

Thank you,
Bahman
