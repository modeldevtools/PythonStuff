Hello,

I am trying to run gaussian 16 on the comet supercomputer. I have been reading the documentation available on the web page of comet but  It is still not clear for me how to run gaussian. I load the module of gaussian already and I tried to run g16 without any success. Could you help me with this? I would like to run gaussian in the home queue since I read that there is not time limit in that queue and I would like to run my jobs without a initial time limit. I also would like to run my gaussian input with the option %cpu=0-8  to be able to tie the first thread to CPU 0, the next to CPU 1, etc; and I would like to use %mem=80GB to give 10GB for of memory for processor.  So I would like to know how should I submit my jobs in such a ways I can run gaussian with those obtions. 

Thanks for your help
