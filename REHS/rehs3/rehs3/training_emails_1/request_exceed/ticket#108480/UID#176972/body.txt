Hi, 

I am trying to run an spark application on comet. The path is:
/home/sasoori/SparkSource/
the batch file is:
job-mnist8m

I am trying to allocate only 16 executors in total using --num-executors=16, but when I check the UI, it seems the spark allocates more than 16 executors(128). Do you know how to set this?

thanks
