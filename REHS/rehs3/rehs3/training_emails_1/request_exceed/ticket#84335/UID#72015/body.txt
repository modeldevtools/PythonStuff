Hi,

I am writing to ask whether there is a upper limit for number of
jobs/amount of time a person can submit for a day. (For some reason, I
didnt find it on your manual page). I am getting error :

Job violates accounting/QOS policy (job submit limit, user's size and/or
time limits)

My account is rita0309.

Thank you!

Best.
