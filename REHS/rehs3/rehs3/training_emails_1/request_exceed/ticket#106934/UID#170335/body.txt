Dear admin,

we have been using the comet cluster with this project (WaterHUB for Hydrologic Modeling and Education | TG-GEO150005), and we recently get this error message when we submitted a job.

$sbatch -o /oasis/scratch/comet/waterhub/temp_project/swatjob/hhawrot/312/output/sim-312.out -e /oasis/scratch/comet/waterhub/temp_project/swatjob/hhawrot/312/output/sim-312.err -p compute -t 10080 -N 1 --qos=oneweek /home/waterhub/swat/run_v2/run_swatsim.sh hhawrot 3428 312 calibration calibration swat2012_627 false 0:

At the time, we already have 5 running jobs. It looks like those running jobs reserved the allocations. Is that correct?
If that is the case, we canâ€™t submit more than 5 jobs at the same time?

Best,
I Luk
