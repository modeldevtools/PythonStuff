Hi,

I'm working in Andy McCammon's group and trying to use our GPU allocation. I've had no trouble in the past submitting jobs using project uoh203, but I haven't tried since we switched all of our CPU hours to GPU a couple of weeks ago. I'm guessing all of our allocation is now in a different project, but when I run show_accounts, the only project that shows up is uoh203 which appears to have no hours remaining and says (ineligible) in the far right column.

I assume I need to be added to the new GPU allocation?

I've cc'd here in case that speeds up the process,

Thanks!

Dan
