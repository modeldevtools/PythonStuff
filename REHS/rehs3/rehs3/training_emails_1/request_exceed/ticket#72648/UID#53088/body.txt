Hello,

      One my grad students, username nilaw001, is running jobs on the comet GPUs, but it says "InvalidQOS" for his jobs (see below)

          10443952 gpu-share      E-3 nilaw001 PD       0:00      1 (InvalidQOS)
          10443954 gpu-share      E-4 nilaw001 PD       0:00      1 (InvalidQOS)
          10443956 gpu-share      E-5 nilaw001 PD       0:00      1 (InvalidQOS)
          10443957 gpu-share      E-6 nilaw001 PD       0:00      1 (InvalidQOS)
          10443959 gpu-share      F-3 nilaw001 PD       0:00      1 (InvalidQOS)
          10443960 gpu-share      F-4 nilaw001 PD       0:00      1 (InvalidQOS)
          10443961 gpu-share      F-5 nilaw001 PD       0:00      1 (InvalidQOS)
          10443962 gpu-share      F-6 nilaw001 PD       0:00      1 (InvalidQOS)
          10443964 gpu-share      V-3 nilaw001 PD       0:00      1 (InvalidQOS)
          10443966 gpu-share      V-4 nilaw001 PD       0:00      1 (InvalidQOS)
          10443967 gpu-share      V-5 nilaw001 PD       0:00      1 (InvalidQOS)
          10443968 gpu-share      V-6 nilaw001 PD       0:00      1 (InvalidQOS)

However, when I look in my comet-gpu account, it says there is plenty of time left and 0% has been used.

Is there something wrong with either the scheduler or portal.xsede in how it's reporting used time?

Thanks,
Prof. Wong
