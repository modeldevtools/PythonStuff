Marty,

Is the following estimate true?

If I run for 3 hours and 96 processors it would "cost" me close to 300 SUs.

It seems that the harder question is how to determine what will be
calculated in an SU.  To understand that calculation I need to figure out
which parameters in my parameter file govern time.  Is it true that one
could do this calculation in some semi-empirical way: run for one step on a
compute node then just multiply by the number of steps in the parameter
before deciding to submit to the queue?

Any direction or hints?  I will poke around on the portal.

Best,

johnny
