[System: Comet]
[Category: Allocations]
Hello,

On Comet, when I run the "id" command, I am told

uid=516860(mrd5285) gid=9946(slc133) groups=9946(slc133),7540(ucb131),8652(slc125),9404(pen144)

Since I've messed this up in the past, I just want to double check I'm using the allocation I think that I'm using.

does slc133 correspond to: 
Computational studies of mixed solvent effects and method development for systematic coarse-graining
Project PI:Noid, William G Charge #:TG-CHE170062
?

Additionally, is there somewhere I can look up what group id corresponds to what allocation for groups that I'm in?

Thanks,

Michael DeLyser
