Hi, we have our last in-class lab period on Tuesday 12/11 11am-12:30pm eastern time. We are requesting a reservation from 11am-1pm on the Comet GPU allocation for 4 gpu nodes. We are flexible on the number of nodes - we have around 35 students completing the course. We believe the reservation will help them complete the exercise in the time allotted. Thanks in advance!
