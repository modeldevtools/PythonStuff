Hello,

We want to transfer some SUs from our COMET allocation to COMET-GPU.

When we go on the XSEDE transfer page, we only see our Stampede2 allocation available for transfer, but not the COMET allocation.

How do we transfer COMET SU's to COMET-GPU?

(We want to transfer 35,000 of our remaining 235,000 SUs from COMET to COMET-GPU)
