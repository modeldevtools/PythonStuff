Dear Help Desk,

When I tried to use Debug mode, I got the error message below:

srun: error: Unable to allocate resources: Requested time limit is invalid (missing or exceeds some limit)

Also, the status of my two submitted jobs are "PD" for along time. Could you please look into these issues and let me know. The attached is the screen shot of the error message. Thank you.
