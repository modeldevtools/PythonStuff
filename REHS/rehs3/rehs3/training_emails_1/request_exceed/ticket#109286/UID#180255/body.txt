[Category: Allocations]
Hi,
I am trying to submit a number of jobs but only a few of them got into the queue. 
Most were rejected with the error shown below.

This is confusing - as a User I have many more hours than the group does:
Allocation available group SUs: 13543
Allocation available user SUs: 368617

Is this because we recently transferred many SUs from stampede2 to comet? We do have 285543.0 SUs on comet and I am not sure why I can not submit jobs.
Thanks in advance,
Michal
