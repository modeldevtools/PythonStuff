Hi sir or madam,
Recently, we got a renew of resources of ~150,000 SUs. But when I tried to run my first job after renew, which requires about 7,200 SUs. It says I exceed my available balance. I don't know if it is due to the lag of update or what. 
Attached are the pictures.
Thank you in advance!
Jasper
