Hello XSEDE,

I am attempting to run a job on comet, and I currently have a trial
allocation. I recently attempted to run this job for 24 hours, and
unfortunately it did not finish in time so I need to re-run it.

I thought that the maximum run time was 48 hours, but when I try to set the
run time for 48 hours I get the following error message:

Any advice on how I can increase the run time so that my job can be
completed?

Thank you!
Ida Naughton
