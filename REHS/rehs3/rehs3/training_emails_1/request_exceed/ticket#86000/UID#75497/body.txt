Hi Help Desk,

I have a set of jobs that I would like to test them on massive scale with 256 nodes and 16 cores per node (4096 cores in total). Jobs are MPI applications from NAS benchmark and a tracing tool based on Intel PIN on top of them. I have successfully tested these jobs on up to 64 nodes (1024 cores/processes). The maximum time is needed for each job is less than 15 minutes.
I was not able to request more than 64 nodes in my job scripts. I am wondering if there is any special queue that I can submit my jobs there or receive some special permission to run my jobs on 256 nodes.
With respect to allocations, our group has almost 40k SUs on Comet at SDSC.

Thanks
Saeed Taheri
