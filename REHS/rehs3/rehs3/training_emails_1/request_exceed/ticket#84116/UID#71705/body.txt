Hi,
The user portal shows that I have 6051 SUs left onComet, but when I try to submit a job for even less than that amount, it says that the requested time exceeds the limit. See below the error (note that the requested SUs is less than available SUs):

[ghiasi@comet-ln3 runFolder]$ sbatch sub
sbatch: error: bank_limit plugin: The requested time can not exceed the available balance.
Requested SUs: 2401
Allocation limit group SUs: 50000
Allocation limit user SUs: 50000
Allocation used group SUs: 43949
Allocation used user SUs: 43949
Allocation available group SUs: 6051
Allocation available user SUs: 6051
Allocation running/queued group SUs: 35050
Allocation running/queued user SUs: 35050
Allocation completed today group SUs: 1715
Allocation completed today user SUs: 1715
sbatch: error: Batch job submission failed: Requested time limit is invalid (missing or exceeds some limit)

Thanks,
Zia
