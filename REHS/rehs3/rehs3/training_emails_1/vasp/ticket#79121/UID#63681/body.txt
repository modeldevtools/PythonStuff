Dear colleague,

This is Yuewen FANG. I have a job submission problem on COMET.

Specifically I want to run a CALYPSO job using machinefile in parallel.

The command of submission: qsub job.sh

Inputfiles: INCAR_1 INCAR_2 INCAR_3 job.sh input.dat POTCAR

working directory: ywfang@comet-ln2.sdsc.edu /home/ywfang/software/CALYPSO_x64/Examples/1_example/fyw_li/parallelmode

For your information, I show the usage of parallel in CALYPSO manual:

The parallel mode of CALYPSO enables the geometrical optimization of structures
through desirable number of CPUs. The parallel mode of CALYPSO supports torque
pbs system.
1. The keywords “Parallel” and “NumberOfParallel” are needed for using the
parallel mode.
For example, you can add ‘Parallel = T’ and ‘NumberOfParallel = 4’ to the
input.dat. NumberOfParallel defines the number of structure relaxations you want
to run in parallel.
2.Modify the pbs script for generating the machinefile. The machinefile is a file that
contains a list of the possible machines on which you want your MPI program to
run.
For example, you should add ‘cat $PBS_NODEFILE > machinefile’ before the
line of executable calypso.x (usually ‘./calypso.x > caly.log’).
3. Modify the script for vasp execution.
For example, you can write the submit.sh as below:
mpiexec –machine snodefile –n 12 vasp > out.vasp 2 > /dev/null

Thank you very much.

Bests
Yuewen
