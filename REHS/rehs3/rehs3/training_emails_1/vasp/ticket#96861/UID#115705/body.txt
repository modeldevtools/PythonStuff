Hi,

I've got a local license for VASP at my home institution, and I'm trying to scale up by using comet.  My test run job failed, but I'm not sure of what happened.

One possibility seems to be that VASP is not available.  My output file starts with "which: no vasp in (... list of path directories ...)".  I've attached the output file.  With a little searching, I found a page that suggested that VASP is a restricted program.  Would there be any way for me to get access, if this is the issue?

It is also possible that I have simply created a bad slurm file or misused ibrun.  Here's what I cobbled together from a colleague's sample file:

#!/bin/bash

#SBATCH --job-name="test run"
#SBATCH --output="sing_zno_test.%j.%N.out"
#SBATCH --nodes=2
#SBATCH --ntasks-per-node=8
#SBATCH --partition=debug
#SBATCH --export=ALL
#SBATCH --mail-user=ebarnes@uwlax.edu
#SBATCH --mail-type=begin
#SBATCH --mail-type=end
#SBATCH -t 00:30:00

# Campus Champion Allocation
#SBATCH -A TG-CCR180031

module load vasp/5.4.4

ibrun -v -n 2 vasp

Any help is appreciated.  Eric
