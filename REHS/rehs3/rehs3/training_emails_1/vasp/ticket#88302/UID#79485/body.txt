Hello,

I am interested in running VASP on Comet, but I am getting a 'permission denied' error when attempting to submit a job calling vasp.popt. I do currently have a license to VASP through my home institution; is there some setup that needs to be done before I can use it on Comet?

Thank you,
James Dean
