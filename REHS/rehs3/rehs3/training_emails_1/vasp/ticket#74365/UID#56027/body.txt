When I attempt to have my .run file request more than one node on the jobs that I am running, I get an error that says:
"There was an error running the SLURM sbatch command.
The command was:
'/usr/bin/sbatch relax.run  2>&1'
and the output was:
'sbatch: error: Not allowed to set the number of nodes in the shared partition.
 sbatch: error: Batch job submission failed: Invalid partition name specified'."

Similarly, when I request more than 20 cores for the single node, I also get an error:
"There was an error running the SLURM sbatch command.
The command was:
'/usr/bin/sbatch relax.run  2>&1'
and the output was:
'sbatch: error: Batch job submission failed: Job violates accounting/QOS policy (job submit limit, user's size and/or time limits)'. "

Is there a reason for this and am I able to request more nodes/cores for my calculations?

My .run file (for my current calculations with the VASP program on Comet) typically look like this:
#!/bin/bash
#SBATCH --nodes=1
#SBATCH --tasks-per-node=20
#SBATCH -t 1:00:00
#SBATCH --job-name="relax"
#SBATCH -p shared
#SBATCH --export=ALL
#SBATCH -A TG-DMR130081
module load mkl/11.1.2.144
mpiexec -np 20 /home/landerso/vasp.5.3.5_constrain_1D/vasp.5.3/vasp >& vasp.out

Thank you, in advance, for your help.
