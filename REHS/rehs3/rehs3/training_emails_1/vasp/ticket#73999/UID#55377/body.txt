Dear Administrator,

I am a graduate student working with Professor Daniel Blankschtein in the Department of Chemical Engineering at MIT. Our research group has a license for VASP (please see below).

Could you please enable my access for VASP on Comet, and also let me know how I can run the program?

Thank you very much,
Ananth Govind Rajan
PhD Candidate, Department of Chemical Engineering, MIT

Subject: FYI --- New VASP Users' Information

Good Morning Rahul and Ananth:

I believe that what you were waiting for has come. You need to take some steps to activate the new software.

Please create an electronic file which includes all information related to VASP for future use in our group.

When done, please inform me and the users in the DB Group.

Best,
           D.B.

Subject: new VASP users' information

Dear Prof. Blankschtein
welcome as new VASP user!

The VASP license number for your vasp- group is: 5-2609

1) Before sending the password to your account on our download portal,
please
REGISTER those colleagues of your research group who will use vasp under
your license by completing  all data requested in the attached form
vasp-users_registration (the format  of the file is simple ASCII txt )
We permanently update the list of VASP users, to provide information
about further developments of VASP
Therefore I kindly ask you  to read the attached form,
fill it in completely (please give EVERYONE involved in
computing with VASP under your license, including research and PhD
students and PostDocs) and send it back to me.
If any of these colleagues stops using VASP (or leaves your group),
please send us a short message to update this list. Someone new
is then of course allowed to start using VASP instead.

according to clause 4 of the the VASP-license agreement,
-- the passwords are given to ONE person per group only (the colleague
who has signed the license agreement on behalf of the research
group), who has to have a permanent position at the research institution
at which the vasp-group is located.
--  It is strictly forbidden to distribute the passwords to anyone else.
Please note that it is a severe violation of the contract if this
clause of the agreement is not observed strictly.

2) VASP-USERS FORUM
please  also have a look at this file giving some basic information
about the VASP-users' forum. Please feel welcome to join the forum
if you  like to.

3) DOWNLOAD OF VASP and the pseudopotentials:
After I have sent you the passwords, please retrieve the code and the
potentials from the download portal
www.vasp.at
 
The VASP site
www.vasp.at
VASP, The Vienna Ab initio simulation package, a plane wave electronic structure code

We will install your account on that platform as soon we have
received the registration of your VASP group members.
Then, please login as user 5-2609  (your vasp-license number)
to your account,
using the password  which will be sent to you  as your primary login
password.  You are welcome to change that password for security reasons

yours sincerely
vasp-support
