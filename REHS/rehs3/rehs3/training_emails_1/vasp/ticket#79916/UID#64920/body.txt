Hi,

For the last few month I was using the VASP.5.4.4 module, which was great (compare to the version I compiled). However, I moved to another group and I no longer have access to the module. Therefore, I would like to get access to the VASP module.

Find attached the licence for our group. Please let me know if you need additional information.

Thanks,
Vancho
