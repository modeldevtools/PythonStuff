Dear XSEDE and SDSC support team:

The following user is collaborating with me on research at NMSU and would like to run VASP and Gaussian calculations on Comet:

Weichuan Xu, graduate student, xsede username: weichuan


Is it possible to get them added to the VASP 5 and Gaussian 09 user groups on Comet? My research group holds a VASP 5 license (see attached, please note the Materials Design email is support@materialsdesign.com as Phil Mages is no longer with the company).

Sincerely,

Thomas Manz, PhD
