Hello, 

I am contacting the help desk because I get the following error message: "Permission denied" whenever I try and perform an action like make a directory or perform a grep search.

This is the my time using the comet infrastructure. I got my account yesterday and my professor Steven Lopez added me to his usage time in the cluster. 

I am trying to run a VASP calculation. Could I get some help with this? Thanks in advance!
