Hi,
I am trying to run vasp calculations but I couldn't run it successfully. And in the vasp/5.4.4, I couldn't find the available executable files.  
vasp.sb file:
#!/bin/bash
#SBATCH --job-name='Fe2O3-2by2'
#SBATCH --nodes=1
#SBATCH --tasks-per-node=24
#SBATCH -t 02:30:00
#SBATCH -o vasp.%j.out
#SBATCH -e vasp.err
#SBATCH -p compute
#SBATCH --export=ALL
module unload mvapich2_ib
module load vasp
ibrun vasp_std >& job.log

Thank you.
