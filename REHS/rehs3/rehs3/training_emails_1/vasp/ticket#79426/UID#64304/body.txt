Hi. I am a new user to XSEDE project TG-DMR090027, and a new PhD student in Prof. Jeffrey C. Grossman's research group. According to my PI, I have been added to the group's VASP licence, presumably by emailing vasp.materialphysik@univie.ac.at, and should submit a ticket to be given access. Please let me know if any further information is required.
