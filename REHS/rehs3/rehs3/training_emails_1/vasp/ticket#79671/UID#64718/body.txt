Hello!
 
I am trying to run VASP on klyukin@comet and it looks that I don't have an access.

>module load vasp
>which vasp_std
which: no vasp_std in "...."

Could you please give us an access to vasp?

Our group have a valid licence on VASP5 (licence holder - Vitaly Alexandrov (valexndrov2@unl.edu), licence number 5-2263). 

Thanks,
Konstantin Klyukin
