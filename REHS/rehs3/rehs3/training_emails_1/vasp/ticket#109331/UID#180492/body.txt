I am in need to also run some VASP simulations on Comet. To test the manner of submitting jobs to Comet I copied the directory /share/apps/examples/VASP, and I tried to run that job. I keep on receiving the error shown below. Can I please be added to also use this software? Thank you very much.  Ana
