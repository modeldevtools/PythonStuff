Hello,

I have been granted XSEDE computational time on SDSC's Comet, and I was
hoping to use the VASP quantum chemistry software. I currently hold a VASP
license, but I do not have a copy of the license itself. I was informed
that I would need to put VASP personnel in touch with someone at SDSC in
order to provide proof of my license and gain access to the VASP on Comet.
Therefore, I was wondering if there is a specific person to whom I should
direct our VASP contact.

Thank you very much!
