hello,

I am postdoctoral researcher at UCLA Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering Department. I work in the group of Professor Philippe Sautet, which has a license for using the quantum-mechanical software package VASP. I would like to get permission to use that software on my startup allocation at Comet.

Thank you in advance,

Tirso

PD. I attach a proof of my affiliation.
