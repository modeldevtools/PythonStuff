Dear colleague,

This is Yue-Wen Fang. I had a problem on Comet (account: ywfang).

Today I compiled the vasp.5.4.4 in my account using the environment by

"
module purge
module load gnutools 
module load intel/2016.3.210
module load intelmpi
"

However, I counldnot run it successfully. Could you help me solve this problem?

For your information, I show an example in the directory "/home/ywfang/vaspwork/pressure/ZnSnO3/R3c/0/scf/test".

The command of job submission I used was 'qsub job.pbs' (see attached).

If any other information is needed, please feel free to ask me. Thank you very much for your help.

Bests
Yuewen
