Dear Help desk,
I am a user of Comet (with ID poliwang). I got two questions:
1 All my files are at /Home/poliwang. In the following days I will process more data. I am worrying about the available disk space. What's the maximum space I can use? If not enough, how should I do?
2 I want to run Matlab at that directory. How can I access Matlab, or what is the directory of Matlab?

Your timely help will be appreciated.
Best,
Lipo
