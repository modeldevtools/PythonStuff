Hi,

I'm new to the Comet and may have some stupid questions. When I use
$ srun --partition=debug --pty --nodes=1 --ntasks-per-node=1 -t 00:30:00
--wait=0 --export=ALL /bin/bash
to start a Matlab session and debug, the session was killed after I tried
to generate a 58,000*58,000 matrix using repmat. Is it because the matrix
is too large? Are there any ways to deal with this problem? Thank you in
advance!

All the best,
Yuanxin
