Hello! I am writing to inquire about a trial usage of Comet for our psychology research. We are using behavioral imaging to record the movement of two people in conversation and require Comet to run the Matlab code we use calculate complexity of the whole body moving for the 13 to 26 segments of data over time. I am not sure how many SUs these analyses require sicne we are testing out different complexity algorithms  (https://datashare.is.ed.ac.uk/handle/10283/2044) and would need to calculate this (though certainly on the very low end relative to average need, I am sure). Many thanks. 

Sincerely,
Mike
