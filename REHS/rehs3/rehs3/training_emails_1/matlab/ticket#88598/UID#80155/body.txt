Hi ,

I would liek to run some matlab code in COmet. I am associated with UCSD. :

efajardo : sds154 nca109 csd453 fna101 nca118
groups: matlab-users: No such user

[efajardo@comet-14-01 ~]$ export=ALL /bin/bash
[efajardo@comet-14-01 ~]$ ls^C
[efajardo@comet-14-01 ~]$ module load matlab
[efajardo@comet-14-01 ~]$ matlab -nodisplay
