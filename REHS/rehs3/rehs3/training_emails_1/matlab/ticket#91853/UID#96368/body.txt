Hi!
Are we able to use the automated matlab 'parallel pool' when running batch scripts on comet?  If so, do I need to do anything to set up the parallel pool, or can I just put parfor loops in the matlab script and it automatically uses all resources that were requested in the sbatch script?

Thanks!
Bryce
