I'm running a job script on Comet that I've run hundreds of times in the past, but today I've been getting this message:

sbatch: error: bank_limit plugin: not found user association ethanr
sbatch: error: Batch job submission failed: Invalid account or account/partition combination specified

What does this mean? I know my account is attached to a project with many available SUs (crl150).

Thanks,

Ethan
