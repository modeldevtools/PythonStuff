Hello,

I'm attempting to submit jobs on the Comet system but I keep getting the following error:

sbatch: error: bank_limit plugin: not found user association ie3md
sbatch: error: Batch job submission failed: Invalid account or account/partition combination specified

I get the same error when I try to run an interactive job with srun:

srun: error: bank_limit plugin: not found user association ie3md
srun: error: Unable to allocate resources: Invalid account or account/partition combination specified

My account should still be valid and has enough credits as far as I'm aware.


Thanks for the help!
