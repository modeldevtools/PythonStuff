Hello,

I recently joined Prof. Franseco Paesani's (fpaesani@ucsd.edu) group and he added me to the list of users who can use his allocations on XSEDE last week. However my jobs keep waiting on the queue with priority reason. I even tried sending the job to 1 node, 1 cpu.

You can see my test run at  /home/vozcelik/test2/singlenode where I submit the testsh file.

Am I doing something wrong? I will be happy if you can help.

My username is: vozcelik

Best,
Ongun
