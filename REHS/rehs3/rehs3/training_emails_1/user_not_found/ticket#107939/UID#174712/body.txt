Dear XSEDE user services team,

Since a day or two ago, I have not been able to run batch jobs on comet. I
can submit them in the queue, but then they hang there indefinitely without
actually running. I was wondering if this is related to the external
connectivity issues that I have been receiving emails about.

The following are the job id's that I have trouble with:
23226030
23226031
23226032

Best,
Eonho
