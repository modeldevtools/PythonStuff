Dear Sir/Ma'am,

I am wrtting to inquire the situation of account user authorization under PI K.N. Houk (project number TG-CHE040013N). The user songyang has been submitted for approval for more than 3 days. Our previous experiences with Xsede suggest that 24 hours are usually enough for the processing. So we are wondering if any problems are encounted for the authorization and if there are anything we can do to accelerate that?

Best,
Song
