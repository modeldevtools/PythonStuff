Hi there, 

I am trying to submit a job to '-p compute' on comet but it gives me an error saying I don't have access. What partitions do I have access to? 

sbatch: error: bank_limit plugin: not found user association monajemi
sbatch: error: Batch job submission failed: Invalid account or account/partition combination specified


Thanks,
Hatef
