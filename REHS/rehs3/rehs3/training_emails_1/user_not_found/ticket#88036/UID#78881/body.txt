Hi,

I am currently unable to submit jobs via sbatch to the compute node on Comet. Attempting to do so yields the following set of error messages:

sbatch: error: bank_limit plugin: not found user association jrd101
sbatch: error: Batch job submission failed: Invalid account or account/partition combination specified

Below is the submission script I'm using (which has worked in the past on the cluster):

#!/bin/env bash
#SBATCH --job-name=zro2_slab_fix
#SBATCH --output=sbatch.outp
#SBATCH --nodes=2
#SBATCH --ntasks-per-node=18
#SBATCH --time=0-20:00:00
#SBATCH --partition=compute

module purge
module load cp2k/4.1

ulimit -s unlimited
ulimit -l unlimited

mpirun -np $SLURM_NTASKS cp2k.popt -i input.inp -o zro2.out


Thanks!
James Dean
