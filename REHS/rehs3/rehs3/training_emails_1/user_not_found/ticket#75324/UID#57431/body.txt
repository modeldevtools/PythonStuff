[Ticket created from XUP by mherling]
[From: Madison Herling]
[System: Comet]
[Category: Access/Login Issues]
My last attempt to submit a job to Comet resulted in the following error:

[mherling@comet-ln2 ~]$ sbatch Methoxonium.sb
sbatch: error: bank_limit plugin: not found user association mherling
sbatch: error: Batch job submission failed: Invalid account or account/partition combination specified

As far as I know, my PI has not authorized the dissociation of my account from the allocation.  Please fix this at your earliest convenience
