Hello, I had used ssh to log into comet.sdsc.xsede.org with username pkhazaei. Once I am logged in, I give command  "sbatch 4EY4B2HN8script2.sb", and it replies with this error message
"sbatch: error: bank_limit plugin: not found user association pkhazaei
sbatch: error: Batch job submission failed: Invalid account or account/partition combination specified"
How can this problem be resolved? Thanks, Pouya.
