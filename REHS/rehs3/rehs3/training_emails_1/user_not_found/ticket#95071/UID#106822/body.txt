To whom it may concern,

It seems that I cannot submit job on comet, although xsede portal shows I have access to comet-cpu.
I used the following to submit a job:
srun --partition=gpu-shared --pty --nodes=1 --ntasks-per-node=6 --gres=gpu:p100:1 -t 00:30:00 --wait=0 --export=ALL /bin/bash
And it returns:
srun: error: bank_limit plugin: not found user association marvinyu
srun: error: Unable to allocate resources: Invalid account or account/partition combination specified

Could you help me with this?

Thanks,
Yu
