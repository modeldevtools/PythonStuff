Hello,

Few days back our total allocation for the project "Plastic Strain Induced Phase Transformations under High Pressure: Multiscale Theory and Simulations in Search for and Synthesis of Novel Nanostructured Phases"    got finished. Thus PI Prof. Levitas requested for some advance allocation for the project under review with you. This morning we got email from your side that the request for the advance has been approved.  Now I checked our account that saw that we have 11% resources (i.e. 234709 SU) corresponding to the project with the above title. Does it mean that we can submit job ?

Actually I tried submitting a job just now. But got the following error message. Can you please tell me what is going wrong?

sbatch: error: bank_limit plugin: not found user association anupb
sbatch: error: Batch job submission failed: Invalid account or account/partition combination specified


Thanks,
Anup
