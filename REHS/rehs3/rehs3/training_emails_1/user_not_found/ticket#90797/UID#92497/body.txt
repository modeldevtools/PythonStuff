[Ticket created from XUP by wangcha]
[From: Chaoran Wang]
[System: Comet]
[Category: Allocations]
Hi,

We applied a start-up allocation on Comet (Charge#: TG-AST180033, PI: Mateusz Ruszkowski) and it got approved earlier today. My account (username: wangcha, name: Chaoran Wang) was added as a user when we went through the allocation application process. When I tried to submit a job on comet by sbatch, an error message returned immediately and the job is cancelled. The message is:

srun: error: bank_limit plugin: not found user association wangcha
srun: error: Unable to allocate resources: Invalid account or account/partition combination specified

For testing, I also tried to request an interactive node using the command in the user guide:

srun --partition=debug --pty --nodes=1 --ntasks-per-node=24 -t 00:30:00 --wait=0 --export=ALL /bin/bash

But the same error message shows up.

Could you please tell me what the problem is?

Best,
Chaoran
