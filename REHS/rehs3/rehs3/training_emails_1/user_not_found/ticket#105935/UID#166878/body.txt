Hi

I ran jobs on comet a while back, but when I tried to submit a job today (with the same script), I got the following message:

srun: error: bank_limit plugin: not found user association cricci
srun: error: Unable to allocate resources: Invalid account or account/partition combination specified

I'm trying to run on the gpu-shared partition.
