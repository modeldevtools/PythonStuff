[Ticket created from XUP by ejp213]

[Category: Accounts]
I have just received access to an allocation on comet-gpu.  It appears in my list of allocations on the XSEDE user portal, and there are a sufficient number of SUs available.  However, when attempting to run a job requesting a GPU, I encounter:

[ejp213@comet-ln3 example]$ sbatch lammps-shared.sb
sbatch: error: bank_limit plugin: not found user association ejp213
sbatch: error: Batch job submission failed: Invalid account or account/partition combination specified

Checking my accounts indicates the following:

[ejp213@comet-ln3 example]$ show_accounts --gpu
ID name      project      used     available    used_by_proj
------------------------------------------------------------

No accounts found for user ejp213 on platform sdsc_comet_gpu.

My PI, who gave me GPU access, has indicated to me that I should have it and everything appears to be working from his end.  Furthermore, I have used and am still using normal Comet (CPU) time and am experiencing no problems.  
Please note that I am using the unmodified /share/apps/examples/GPU/LAMMPS/shared example above.
