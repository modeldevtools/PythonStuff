Hi,

I have and account, shakib,  on Comet, I can login and make changes there but when I'm trying to submit a job it says "Invalid account or account/partition combination specified".

When I try "show_accounts", I receive "No accounts found for user shakib on platform sdsc_comet". I don't understand what is going on. Could you please help me with this problem.

Thank you kindly,

Farnaz Shakib
