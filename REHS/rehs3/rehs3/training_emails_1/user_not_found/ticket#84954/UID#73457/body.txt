Hi,

I am not able to submit job on comet and when I do I get the following error:
sbatch: error: bank_limit plugin: not found user association mkhoshle
sbatch: error: Batch job submission failed: Invalid account or account/partition combination specified

Could you please tell me why I am getting this error?

Thanks,
