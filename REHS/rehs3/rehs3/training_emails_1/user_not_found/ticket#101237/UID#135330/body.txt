Hello,

I'm relatively new to supercomputing and I am trying to port a code from
Maverick to Comet. I'm trying to request an interactive node for debugging
using the following command directly from the XSEDE website:

srun --partition=debug --pty --nodes=1 --ntasks-per-node=24 -t 00:30:00
--wait=0 --export=ALL /bin/bash

However, I get the following errors:

srun: error: bank_limit plugin: expired user, can't submit job
srun: error: Unable to allocate resources: Invalid account or
account/partition combination specified

My XSEDE portal shows that I have access to Comet GPU. My username is
mwadas. Please let me know how I can get access to a debugging node.

Thanks,
