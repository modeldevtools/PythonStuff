Hi,

I recently have problem submitting jobs on comet, and it gives me this error:

There was an error running the SLURM sbatch command.
The command was:
'/usr/bin/sbatch jobscr.comet-sleep  2>&1'
and the output was:
'sbatch: error: bank_limit plugin: error talking to slurm, please try again
 sbatch: error: Batch job submission failed: Error configuring interconnect


I was wondering if there is any error. My username is: esayyari, and my group ID is uot138
Best,
Erfan
