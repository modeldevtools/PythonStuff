[Ticket created from XUP by atrettel]
[From: Andrew Trettel]
[System: Comet]
[Category: Batch Queues/Jobs]
I'm coming back from a few months without running any jobs, and I seem to have an error when I submit my job script.  I'm running on SDSC Comet.

All of the files I'm using are at 

/oasis/scratch/comet/atrettel/temp_project/M2.5-R24500-adiabatic-gridA

Specifically, I'm running

sbatch job_preprocess.sh

and I get the following error message:

sbatch: error: bank_limit plugin: not found user association atrettel
sbatch: error: Batch job submission failed: Invalid account or account/partition combination specified

I can't make heads or tails of what this means, so I'd appreciate any help you can provide.  The .sh files have not been modified since March and worked the last time I ran them.
