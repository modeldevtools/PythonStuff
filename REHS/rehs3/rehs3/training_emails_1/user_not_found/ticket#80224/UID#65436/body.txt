When trying to run a job on Comet, the system reports the following error messages: "sbatch: error: bank_limit plugin: not found user association wyf" and "sbatch: error: Batch job submission failed: Invalid account or account/partition combination specified".

I checked my Xsede user portal. It is shown that the status of my Comet|SDSC is "healthy". I am new to Comet and have no idea what is going on. Could you please advise as to why these error messages show up and how to avoid them?

Thank you!
