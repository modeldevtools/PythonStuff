Hi,

I was trying to run jobs today but got this message:

sbatch: error: bank_limit plugin: not found user association hassan8
sbatch: error: Batch job submission failed: Invalid account or account/partition combination specified

Please let me know what is the issue with this. 

Thank you.

Hassan
