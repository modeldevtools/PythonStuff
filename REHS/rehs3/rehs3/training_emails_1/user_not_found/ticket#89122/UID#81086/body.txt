Hello, 

I used to submit job successfully last year. But I have trouble in submitting jobs today.

My username is yqm12. I cannot find the name of my project.

The details of the calculation that I run are as following.

[qiaomu@comet-ln3 TbCl6]$ qsub TbCl6.sb
There was an error running the SLURM sbatch command.
The command was:
'/usr/bin/sbatch TbCl6.sb  2>&1'
and the output was:
'sbatch: error: bank_limit plugin: not found user association qiaomu
 sbatch: error: Batch job submission failed: Invalid account or account/partition combination specified
