Hi,

I have been trying to get IDL on comet but since yesterday I could not get any. I am getting the following msg:


srun --pty --nodes=1 --ntasks-per-node=24 -L idl:1 -p compute -t 36:30:00 --wait 0 /bin/bash
srun: Required node not available (down, drained or reserved)
srun: job 13514021 queued and waiting for resources


It has happened once before but I just want to make sure the command I gave is correct and the machines are running fine. 

Also,two days back, I noticed that a code that has been running very well until then did not run at all - and there was no error message. 

I would greatly appreciate if you could look into this when you get a chance.

Thank you very much!
Bala
