When Matthew Ward (user name mward97) attempts to submit a gaussian job on comet using the sample gauss_16.revA.sb script he is getting the following error:

sbatch: error: bank_limit plugin: not found user association mward97
sbatch: error: Batch job submission failed: Invalid account or account/partition combination specified

Your help would be greatly appreciated.
