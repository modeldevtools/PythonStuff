HI there,

I was trying to submit a job as usual. However, it was not successful and I got the following message:
sbatch: error: bank_limit plugin: not found user association pdu83
sbatch: error: Batch job submission failed: Invalid account or account/partition combination specified
Other people from our group have the same issue. 
Would you please help us. Thank you very much.

best,
Pengfei
