After April 1st when my group got a new grant of resources, I haven't been able to run jobs on Comet. The Xsede portal says that I have access to resources, but running jobs gives the error:

 "
sbatch: error: bank_limit plugin: not found user association jcavin
sbatch: error: Batch job submission failed: Invalid account or account/partition                                      combination specified
"
