Dear sir/madam,
      I encountered the following problem when I tried to submit jobs on Comet.
sbatch: error: bank_limit plugin: not found user association rkong66
sbatch: error: Batch job submission failed: Invalid account or account/partition combination specified
     Do you have any idea about it?
Thanks
Rong
