Hello, 

I just wanted to check if I have the early access to allocation TG-DMR170112 on SDSC Comet. Previously we have asked the early start during the renewal request submission and it seemed that we have the early start on Bridges for the same allocation. 

If I do have the access, could you help me on a batch job error which read as follows?
"sbatch: error: bank_limit plugin: user is disallowed to submit jobs
sbatch: error: Batch job submission failed: Invalid account or account/partition combination specified"
I tried in the job script  either not specifying the project id and using the default, or having "#SBATCH -A utk120". utk120 is the only project available when I typed "show_accounts". However, neither worked. 

If I don't have the access, may I ask for that?

Best,
Liubin
