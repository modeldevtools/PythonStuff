[Category: Allocations]
Hi, I have allocation for using comet and comet-gpu, however, when I want to submit a job or start an interactive mode, I got this error, which does not make sense. 

srun: error: bank_limit plugin: not found user association mkamani
srun: error: Unable to allocate resources: Invalid account or account/partition combination specified

I have changed my group allocation from pen135 to pen150, which is the most recent one and still active.
