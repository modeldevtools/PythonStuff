When I tried to submit a job on comet, it showed the following error message. 

[ddwan@comet-ln2 test2_mpb]$ sbatch disk.sub 
sbatch: error: bank_limit plugin: not found user association ddwan
sbatch: error: Batch job submission failed: Invalid account or account/partition combination specified

I received your email yesterday saying submission issues on Comet solved. i don't know if it was the same kind of problem mentioned in the email. I tried it again just now, still doesn't work.
