Hello
I have resource allocation for comet-sdsc (Project PI: Carol Hall), and my
username is ssarma2. However, I am not being able to run the jobs. My
xsede account shows my project allocation as active, but whenever I try to
submit my job it comes up with the error:
bank limit plugin:user is disallowed to submit jobs.
Batch job submission failed: Invalid account or partition combination
specified

Thank You
