Dear Sir/Madam,

Although 234709.0 of 1976000.0 SUs for the allocation TG-MSS170015 has remained and our request for an Advance Research Request  prior to the decision for our renewal request has been accepted recently (Awarded Resources: SDSC Dell Cluster with Intel Haswell Processors (Comet): 250,000.0 SUs) when I try to submit job today it says:

sbatch: error: bank_limit plugin: not found user association hbabaei
sbatch: error: Batch job submission failed: Invalid account or account/partition combination specified

I appreciate if you could let me know how and when I can submit my job. Your prompt attention will be appreciated. 

Thanks and regards,
