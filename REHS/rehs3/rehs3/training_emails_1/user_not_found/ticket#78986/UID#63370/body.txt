Hi,

I want to run VASP jobs on comet but when I try to submit a job, I get following error:

sbatch: error: bank_limit plugin: not found user association rbatra
sbatch: error: Batch job submission failed: Invalid account or account/partition combination specified


I used comet successfully last year, but I don't know why its throwing error now. Here is the path on comet where I was trying to run VASP job:

"/oasis/scratch/comet/rbatra/temp_project/al_big_dataset/a2/v9"

Can you please help me resolve this.

Thanks for you help.

Thanks and regards,
