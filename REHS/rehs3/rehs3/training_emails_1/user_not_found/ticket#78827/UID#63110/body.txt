Hello, 

I have been submitting some jobs on comet today, and after some time, I ended up with the following error message:

sbatch: error: bank_limit plugin: error talking to slurm, please try again
sbatch: error: Batch job submission failed: Error configuring interconnect

A quick google search did not yield any information about this error.
Could you clear up for me what this error is about please, and how to resolve it?

Best,

Brandon Horan
