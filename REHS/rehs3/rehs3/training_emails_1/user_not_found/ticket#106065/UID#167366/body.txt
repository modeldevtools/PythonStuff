Dear XSEDE or Comet HelpDesk,

I am the allocation manager for TG-MCA03S007. I verified our users. One of our users (buyukalp), who was verified on our renewal allocation on Comet ~24 hours ago, seems to be having some problems running batch jobs on Comet. Here is the error message:

sbatch: error: bank_limit plugin: not found user association buyukalp
sbatch: error: Batch job submission failed: Invalid account or account/partition combination specified

Please advise.

Best regards,

Peter B. Catrysse, Ph.D.
