Dear XSEDE Support,

I am a user of XSEDE with account name fahdam. While trying to queue jobs on Comet today, I am getting the following error :

"sbatch: error: bank_limit plugin: not found user association fahdam
sbatch: error: Batch job submission failed: Invalid account or account/partition combination specified"

It would be very helpful if you could let me know whether anything is wrong with the scheduler, or is there a problem with my account?

Thanks,
Fahd Mohiyaddin
