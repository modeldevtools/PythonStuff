Hi there,

I encountered this error when I use show_accounts:

No accounts found for user xfgavin on platform sdsc_comet.

In the same time, when submitting jobs to slurm, I saw this error:
sbatch: error: Batch job submission failed: Invalid account or account/partition combination specified
sbatch: error: bank_limit plugin: not found user association xfgavin


Please help.
Thanks.
