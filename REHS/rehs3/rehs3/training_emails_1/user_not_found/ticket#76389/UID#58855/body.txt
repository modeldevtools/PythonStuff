Dear Sir/Madame,

I am trying to submit a job in Comet to Gaussian, but I get the following error message:

sbatch: error: bank_limit plugin: not found user association dlopezb
sbatch: error: Batch job submission failed: Invalid account or account/partition combination specified

If I check our usage of Comet, we should have enough computing ours available. What could cause this message?

Thanks in advance.

With best regards,

Diego
