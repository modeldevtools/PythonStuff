Hello.

I added Yichul Choi (student) to my XSEDE account (SDSC Comet) but
as you see below, he was not added and he cannot have
access to Comet. My other student, John Villanova, was
also added and he has no problem in accessing Comet.
The only difference between the two students is that
for Yichul his email address listed in XSEDE (yichul00@naver.com)
differs from his usual VT email address (yichul00@vt.edu).
Would you please fix this problem? Thank you.

Regards,
Kyungwha

Dear Kyungwha:

It' strange since you added me and Jack on comet in the same way, and Jack's comet account is
working fine, but I was still not able to run a test job on comet, qsub failed with an error
message saying "not found user association yichul00" and when I do "show_accounts", I get "No
accounts found for user yichul00 on platform sdsc_comet." So it looks like I'm not really added,
but I'm not sure why.

Regards,
Yichul
