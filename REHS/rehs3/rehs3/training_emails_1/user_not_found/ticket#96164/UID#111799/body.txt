[Category: Access/Login Issues]
Hello, 

I have not been able to submit jobs to Comet since my group's renewal started on October 1st. When I submit a batch file I get two errors: 

bank_limit plugin: not found user association simonhe
Batch job submission failed: Invalid account or account/partition combination specified

However, I'm still able to ssh to Comet. 

Another individual in the group has also had the same issues. 
I have checked with the PI on my project and my account has been verified for access to all of our resources during this renewal. 

We have access to both Comet and Stampede2, and are still able to submit jobs to stampede2 normally. 

Thank You,
Simon He
