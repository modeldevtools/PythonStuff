Hi,

I can not edit or write a file since it shows:

E138: Can't write viminfo file /home/taoyu/.viminfo!
Press ENTER or type command to continue


I think that is because my directory has been full. I removed some files and released some free space, however it still does not work.

Please give some help here.

Best,

Tao
