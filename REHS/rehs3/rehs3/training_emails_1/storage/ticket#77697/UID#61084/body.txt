Hi,

When I submit a job that computes on large arrays, it gives malloc failure.

An array size of 2.03GB has no problem, but when it goes over that the malloc fails.

I don't understand why it fails because, as far as I know, each node of comet-gpu contains Intel Xeon CPU E5-2680 processors of 128 GB main memory. 

Is there any restriction on the amount of CPU memory that I can allocate? 
If that's true and this is controlled by system administrator, is there any way to get rid of the restriction?

Best regards,
Hyun Dok
