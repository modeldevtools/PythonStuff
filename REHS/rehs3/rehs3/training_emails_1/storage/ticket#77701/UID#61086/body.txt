Hello, 

For RELION jobs, this typically involves running 1 - 300 GB of data on Comet GPU nodes, that are usually divided amongst 100-6000 files. 

Could you give me the 'optimal' job submission script? I'm assuming this means copying data onto the scratch space for the node, but I wasn't sure what the best way to do this. 

Thank you,
Mike
