Hi,
I am running MD simulations using GROMACS on Comet. My working directory is /oasis/projects/nsf/wag100/aksharma and I checked that the overall usage of disk space in that folder is 489 GB. My gromacs jobs are getting terminated with out of disk space error. On the Xsede page, my account shows that I have 100% space available on Oasis.  The error message I am getting is:
Fatal error:
XTC error - maybe you are out of disk space?
The job submission scripts have been working fine. Is there something wrong with my space utilization? I appreciate any guidance you may be able to provide to overcome this problem. 

Thanks,
Arun
