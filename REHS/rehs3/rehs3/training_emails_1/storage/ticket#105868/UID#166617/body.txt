Hi,

I was trying to compress my folders in my scratch folder "/oasis/scratch/comet/mhorii/temp_project/NovaSeq_PE150"
I run one job to zip the file using tar, but it went up to 3 times more bigger file. (original folder is 100G and it went to 350G so I killed the job)
I was thinking either moving all of my folders to the csd414 by itself, but before doing that, I wanted to ask your opinion if there are any way to make it smaller(the folder that I don't need to access often can be zipped).

Please let me know if there are anything I can try before moving everything...

Thank you very much for your help.

Mariko

Hi Mariko,

The Lustre scratch filesystem on SDSC Comet (/oasis/scratch/comet) is now over 90% full. For performance and space considerations we need to clear up old data in this location. You are receiving this email since you have over 1TB of data in /oasis/scratch/comet/mhorii.  Please take a look at your data and clear up any files that are not required for ongoing simulations.

We would also like to remind that this location is a) scratch space that is *not* backed up => please make offsite copies of critical data, and b) not meant to store data for the long term (recommended resident time is < 3 months). We are continuing to monitor the usage and if needed will have to do an automated purge of old data on short notice. Your cooperation in cleaning up old files will be helpful in avoiding this step.

Please email help@xsede.org (for XSEDE users) or consult@sdsc.edu (for non-XSEDE users) if you have any questions.

Thank you,
SDSC User Services
