Hello,

We would like to download a large (~10Tb) dataset to scratch space on comet temporarily which we will delete after processing it. However we are running into disk quota issues. I undertsand that disk space quotas are accounted for based on the group that owns a file, which is tied to our allocation. We wanted to know:

1. Is there a group we can use besides our main allocation for larger files stored in scratch space? I see previously my scratch files had group sds154 which I think was for the trial account.
2. Is there a way to change our default group? For instance my student is on my main allocation but by default his group on login to comet is for an expired allocation.

Thanks,
~Melissa
