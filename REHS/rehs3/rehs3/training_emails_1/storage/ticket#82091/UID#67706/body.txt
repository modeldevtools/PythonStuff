Hi,
Sorry to bother you but I need your help clarifying something for me. I am using Comet to run openFoam jobs. I need to save large data and I am not sure which storage to use. Do I save the files to my home directory? If yes , I am facing quota issue when I run several cases and I am not sure how to access additional storage!  On Bridges we have ptlon2 and pylon5 , on comet I tried to read the user manual but I couldn't figure this out. 

Sorry for that and I hope you have time to help me with this.

regards,

Bashar
