Hi Sir/Madam

I have a question about the allocated hard disk, when we check our allocated resources, we found we have hard disk like following: 
SDSC Medium-term disk storage (Data Oasis): 2,609.0 GB

while we also found our hard disk for mia174 account (/oasis/projects/nsf/mia174) is still 500GB, could you please let me know why there is the difference here? Does the SDSC Medium-term disk storage (Data Oasis) mean another resource? We are slightly confusing about this. Thank you.

Best

Wei Zheng
