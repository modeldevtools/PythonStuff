Dear XSEDE admin,

Regarding education allocation Charge #:TG-DMR190017
I have an existing educational allocation as the PI. I already added my students as users to the allocation. There is also home directory set up for me.  My question is how the added uses can access to the filesystem, i.e. is a home directory set up for them or is there a share folder where all the users can access? I would really appreciate it if you could guide me with this since the students have to start running their project.

Thank you so much
Best Regards
