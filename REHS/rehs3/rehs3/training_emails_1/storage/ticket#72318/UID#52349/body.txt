Hello,
I have not been able to successfully check my quota on my start-up allocation:

[weihsr@comet-ln3 weihsr]$ quota
quota: error while getting quota from ps-073.sdsc.edu:/ps-data/janssen3/ for weihsr (id 514659): Connection refused
quota: error while getting quota from ps-009.sdsc.edu:/ps-data/ngbt/ for weihsr (id 514659): Connection refused

Please let me know what I should be doing differently?

Thank you,
Rachel Weihs
