I am trying to create files of size of  1 mega by the command "dd" in the "/oasis/scratch/comet/alhussen/temp_project" folder but when the file created the size of file is 512. I tried to create the files on the folder "/home/alhussen", it works well but I could not run the command "lfs getstripe", the error is "can't get lov name." My works based on the size of files and the command "lfs getstripe" , so how I can solve the problem? 

Thank you
