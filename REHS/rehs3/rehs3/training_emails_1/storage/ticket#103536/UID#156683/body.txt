Hi there,
I have an issue on storage.
My allocation under project neb106 is 2,000 GB.
Up to now, the usage on my scratch folder in comet is 494,760 MB and the usage on the project folder is 47,651 MB.
However, when I want to copy some files (totally about 20 MB) to the project folder, I was told "Disk quota exceeded"
Using 'df' command, the usage of disk is shown below:
192.168.0.6@tcp:192.168.8.6@tcp:/wombat
                     2735474318080 2424484987136 310841037440  89% /oasis/scratch/comet
192.168.16.6@tcp:192.168.24.6@tcp:/panda
                     2779705166720 2286095697536 492724465280  83% /oasis/projects/nsf


Could anyone help me on this?

best,

Jie-Xiang
