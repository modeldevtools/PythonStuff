Dear XSEDE,

I have a start-up allocation: TG-DMR170065. The storage space in Data Oasis
is 750 GB.

I and my group members transferred files to Data Oasis. However, it is
still showing we have 100% (750 GB) space available there. We are just
curious whether the information is not getting updated. Please clarify our
doubt.

Thank you very much for your help and cooperation.
