Hi,

I got accepted a startup allocation at Comet on February, I already have
1,000GB of disk storage. However, I would like to know if I can request an
extra 1,000GB of storage for the project. We are running out of storage for
the simulations that we have and I would like to know if it is possible to
have more disk storage space.
