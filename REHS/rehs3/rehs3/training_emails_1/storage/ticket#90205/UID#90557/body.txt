Hello, Nickel,

 

I am Lei Zhang. My XSEDE ID is lzhang14. I submitted a job on /oasis/scratch/comet/lzhang14/temp_project (10T storage limitation and 2M file number limitation according to the Comet User Guide). However, we can not finish even one simulation because of the limitation of file number or the(error: Disk quota exceeded). We need to generate over 2.7M files and need over 2T storage to finish one simulation. Could you please expand the file number to 3M (for per simulation) or more? Plus,  could you please check its storage limitation for us? Thank you in advance.




Best,




Lei
