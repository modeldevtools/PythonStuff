I've been consistently getting a "disk quota exceeded" error despite the fact that I've been using only 5.7G in my home directory and 304M on Oasis directory /oasis/projects/nsf/csd550/ashish1.  I haven't been able to run any jobs due to this and we have a deadline that's coming up soon (on Friday).  I'd very much appreciate your help resolving this soon.  Thanks!
