Hi,

I am wondering how to check my disk quota from an ssh session. This reference<https://portal.xsede.org/storage> says the ‘quota’ command should do it, but I am getting errors like:



quota: error while getting quota from comet-fe5.local:/export/sw/intel/2016.3.210 for tnc100 (id 10123): Connection refused



On the Xsede portal, my Oasis quota says 0 of 1000GB, but I am using ~350GB on my projects filesystem under /oasis/projects/nsf



How can I best monitor my disk usage on Oasis? Using the du command is often extremely slow due to the large number of files in some of my directories.



Can you also verify that my quota is in fact 1000GB? I recently started getting disk quota errors and I only seemed to be around 500GB, which I think is the default allocation.



Thank you.
