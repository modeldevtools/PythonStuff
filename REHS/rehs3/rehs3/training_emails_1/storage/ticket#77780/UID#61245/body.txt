Hello,

According to my instructor I should have a $WORK environment variable defined to /oasis/scratch/comet/jhellmer/temp_project.

The folder exists, but I don’t have the environment variable.

I can edit my .bashrc to add this, but I’m wondering if this wasn’t done for my user account perhaps other things might have been missed as well.


My user account is: jhellmer
