Hello,

I'm using globus to transfer the data onto Comet. I want to transfer 200GB imagenet onto the machine but globus only permits me to transfer the data onto comet home directory, /home/lwang53. So my questions is, 1) how large is my home directory? 2) is there a way to directly transfer the data to /oasis/scratch/comet/$USER/temp_project ? Thank you.
