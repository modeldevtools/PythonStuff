In my recent job output file, it always show "forrtl: No space left on device
forrtl: severe (38): error during write, unit 8, file /oasis/scratch/comet/qingzhao/temp_project/14085695/fort.8.pe1". 

It looks like I have no space under my scratch folder, however, I deleted all old files and there are only my running jobs there. 

When I run a calculation, I let it run under "/oasis/scratch/comet/$USER/temp_project" folder and all my output files are saved under "/oasis/projects/nsf" folder
