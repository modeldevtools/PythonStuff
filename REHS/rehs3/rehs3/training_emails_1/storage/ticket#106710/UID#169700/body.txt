Dear XSEDE,
I am trying to download some data through Globus from SFARI to my endpoints XSEDE Comet. I could transfer data on Globus ok, from SFARI to xsede#comet. However, I couldn’t find the transferred data in my folder, /oasis/tscc/scratch/naj018, which is my Globus endpoints that worked before.
Do you know what’s going wrong here? Can you help me to fix it?
Thank you very much.
Nan
