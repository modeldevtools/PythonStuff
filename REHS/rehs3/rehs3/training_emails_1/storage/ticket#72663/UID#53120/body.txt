Hi 

I have a question regarding storage time for oasis project. 
Is there any place other than "/oasis/projects/nsf/uic342/" that I can store data more than project time?
I have a quite huge amount of data which makes it difficult to find another place to store. Is there any way or places which I can store data for a short time (~2-3 months) after ending my allocation time?

Thanks
Morteza
