Dear Sir/Madam,

I am working with an open source FEM program called deal.II. I have recently tried to run my code on 4 nodes and got the following error:

PETSC ERROR: Caught signal number 11 SEGV: Segmentation Violation, probably memory access out of range...

It works fine when I run the code on 2 nodes. I am wondering if you know where is the problem and if there is a limitation for the number of nodes or the memory.

Thanks.
