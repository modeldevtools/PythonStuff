Hello,

I have never used a storage allocation other than the default of 500GB on Comet before.
In our new allocation, number TG-MCB180021, we received a 10000GB allocation for storage on Oasis.
I attempted to store files in 
/oasis/projects/nsf/lhu116/bhoran92/
but I hit the 500GB limit and was unable to store additional files there.

Am I putting my files in the correct location?
I noticed on my Xsede portal it says I don't have any files stored on Oasis.
Could you please help me know how to use this allocation properly?
Are the files stored in the allocation left easily available for long-term storage while the account is active?

Thank you in advance.

Best,

Brandon Horan
