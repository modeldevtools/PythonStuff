Hi,

I'm user ptrefftz and am trying to run a simulation on Comet. I am
receiving the error:

/usr/bin/xauth:  error in locking authority file /home/ptrefftz/.Xauthority

I have found online that this may be due to using more disk space than I am
allocated. I saw on the Comet site that we are allocated 500GB per project.
I cleared up some space on of my own files. Is there a way to know how much
space is being used by everyone on my project?

Do you think that this is what is causing the error? If so, when should I
try running my simulation again so that the changes in disk space are
reflected and the Xauthority file can be properly created?

Or could there be another cause?

Thanks,

Pablo
