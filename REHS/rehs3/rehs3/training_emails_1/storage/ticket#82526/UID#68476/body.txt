Hi I'm a new user and am confused about file storage.

I have 20G of data that I need to move to comet as input for my GPU jobs
Where is the appropriate place to store them?

Where is the appropriate place to store temporary output that gets written every couple iterations? Over 2500 iterations I generate roughly 80MB of data in roughly 2500 text files.
