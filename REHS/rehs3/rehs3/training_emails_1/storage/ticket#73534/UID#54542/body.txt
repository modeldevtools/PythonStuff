Hello there, 

I have a question about Comet cluster. It has got only home directory for installing codes and scratch for running jobs. I was wondering if the scratch is backed up or not. I used to work on Stampede and it had home, work (backed up) and scratch while here in comet there is only scratch not work. Could you please let me know if the scratch is backed up here or not? Thanks in advance. 

best,
Pedram
