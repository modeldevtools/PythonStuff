Dear Comet admin,

I am seeing a disk quota overrun when I attempt to write to my oasis space.
Xdusage shows 4 TB allocated and 4 TB available.
The XSEDE portal shows my allocation to be 8 TBytes.
In any case, I haven't found a way to get the system to tell me how much I am actually using.

In order to deal with the immediate problem, I have put in an advance request on my allocation renewal for 12 TBytes.
Please let me know if you have some direction how to proceed for the both the short and longer terms.

Thanks - Don
