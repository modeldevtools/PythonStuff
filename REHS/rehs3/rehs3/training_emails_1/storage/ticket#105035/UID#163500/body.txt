To Whom it may Concern:

I am trying to run some simulations on comet, and simply putting the input file on 

/oasis/projects/nsf/$project_number/$user/  ($project_number = rut140, $user = smb448)

tells me 'Disk quota exceeded'. I only have 277 MBs of files stored there, and as I understand, I should be able to store up to 500 GB. I have checked with other user account, and the entire project has a total of <700 MB

How can I fix this problem? Is there something I am missing?
