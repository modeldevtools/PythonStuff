Hi,
I am trying to find how often the log in /proc/fs/lustre get updated. I was
creating some files in a particular ost and observing the stats file for
that OST. But I noticed although the file is creating properly
"write_bytes" field in the stats file is not changing. I created ~25GB file
but the total size was still the same. That's why I was wondering how often
does the log file gets updated?   I was using sdsc comet.

Regards.
