Hi,


I'm trying to use my OASIS quota, but receive an error "Disk quota exceeded" (see commands below).


My allocation is 5 TB, and I haven't started to use it yet.


My commands:


[oleksanf@comet-ln3 oleksanf]$ rsync -avP oleksandr@ip24.ucsd.edu:/space/syn03/1/data/GWAS/SUMSTAT/misc .
oleksandr@ip24.ucsd.edu's password:

misc/
misc/11015833_ref.bim
      786432   0%  702.01kB/s    0:07:31
rsync: write failed on "/oasis/projects/nsf/csd604/oleksanf/misc/11015833_ref.bim": Disk quota exceeded (122)
rsync error: error in file IO (code 11) at receiver.c(301) [receiver=3.0.6]
rsync: connection unexpectedly closed (447 bytes received so far) [generator]
rsync error: error in rsync protocol data stream (code 12) at io.c(600) [generator=3.0.6]
[oleksanf@comet-ln3 oleksanf]$ pwd
/oasis/projects/nsf/csd604/oleksanf


Sorry if it's some obvious mistake -  I'm new to COMET and OASIS, but I've read through https://portal.xsede.org/sdsc-dataoasis . Please assist...

?Kind regards,
Oleksandr
