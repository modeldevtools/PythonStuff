Hi,


I am inquiring as to whether there is room to add space to my allocation on comet, username jwestern. My collaborators and I have realized we need to do some secondary runs in order to calibrate the first ones we have already done, and working with my current 15 Tb of space makes this challenging.


Thank you,


John
