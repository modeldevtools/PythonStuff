I have a very large .rar (1TB) file in google drive.This is everything I transferred from Xstream (the retired server). But I don't have such a computer to uncompress that big file. Can I unzip that file on Comet? Do I have enough space for it? Or do you have any better idea? Any suggestions would be appreciated! Thanks!
