Hello,
My account on Comet (hamln19) is unusually slow today. I have been recently receiving error messages regarding a lack of space. However, it is taking over an hour to delete a file. Could overall lack of space be the issue? I am unable to check my quota using the quota command. Any help would be appreciated.
Thank you,
Lauren Hamm
