Hi,
    Now I want to diagonalize a large matrix whose size is close to 1TB, and thus the large memory node would be suitable. On the other hand, since I didn't parallelize the diagonalization algorithm, only single core might be used. However, the DRAM of a single core is not enough for such a big matrix. So I was wondering whether I need to assign 64 cores for this job, or I just need to request 1TB with a single core?

Best
