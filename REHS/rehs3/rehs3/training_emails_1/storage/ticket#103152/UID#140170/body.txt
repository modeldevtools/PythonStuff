Dear support team,

I'm having trouble storing experiment result on COMET. COMET User Guide 
mentions three storage: home directory, local scratch and parallel 
Lustre filesystem. It states that home directory should only contain 
source code and should be kept under 100GB. Local scratch space appears 
to be transient, since it's accessible only during execution, and since 
the directory keeps changing for every job. It's thus impossible for me 
to retrieve the experiment result after running the program. Therefore I 
chose the Lustre filesystem. However, after I have written results to 
it, I cd to that directory and found there was nothing (both from home 
directory and doing `ls` non-interactively in a subsequent sbatch 
script). Is it also a transient file system? If so, how should I store 
the experiment result?

The size of experiment result can grow up to 500GB. But usually I will 
delete most of them and reduce the size down to 20GB after some manual 
selection.

Thank you so much for your suggestion.
