I am attempting to submit an excited-state geometry optimization calculation on a relatively small organic molecule using GAMESS. It appears that for EOM-CCSD calculations are only allowed to be run on one processor, and that the memory limit on each processor is "only" 1,000,000 words. As a result, my calculation is running out of memory because the required memory is 1,268,132,162 words(?!). Does this seem unusual? How could I get around this memory/CPU issue?

Thank you,

Steven
