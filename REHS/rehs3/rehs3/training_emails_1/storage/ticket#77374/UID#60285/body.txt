Hello,
My current start-up allocation (TG-ATM170006) has been somewhat constrained by our limited disk space for numerical weather prediction simulation storage.  I was wondering if we could apply for a slight increase in our disk space cap until our department storage servers are installed?  Perhaps to 100GB.

Thanks for your consideration,
Rachel Weihs
