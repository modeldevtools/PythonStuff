Dear XSEDE Support,

I am using Gaussian 09 on Comet to perform geometry optimization of a relatively large molecule (78 atoms). During this process several scratch files are produced, which are deleted upon completion of the task. At first, I was exporting those files to the 250 GB flash storage on the compute nodes, but I was getting the error "No space left on device". After that I tried to export the scratch files  to a larger SSD of 1464 GB as suggested in the XSEDE Comet User Guide but the run crashed because the path seemed to be incorrect. I attached the error file and my job script. Could You tell me if I have a mistake in my job script or if I just don't have a permission to use that storage?

Thank You for Your help.

Respectfully Yours,

Lev
