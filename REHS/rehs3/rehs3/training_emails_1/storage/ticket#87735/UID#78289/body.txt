Hello,


Previously I've contacted XSEDE support for issues running QE, which turned out to be caused by not requesting resources with enough memory for my job. Since then I've moved on to modeling another system, related, but a little more memory-intensive. Is there a good way to see how much memory completed jobs used, and/or to request memory allocation through mpirun? I'm still learning my way around XSEDE, SLURM, MPI, and QE, so I'm just not sure what tools I have available for memory management and what the best strategy is for efficiently allocating and using resources. Please let me know if this is a question that I should contact the QE developers or someone else with. Any help you could give me would be greatly appreciated.


Regards,
