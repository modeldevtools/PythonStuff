[Category: Access/Login Issues]
I am wondering if the two accessible directories on Comet are home and scratch? Is the total space available in home about 40 Gb? Is there a limit in scratch? 

If scratch is occasionally purged, is it possible to be placed on the no-purge list through end of December?

Thank you.
