Hello,

I am a graduate student working in the Department of Chemical Engineering at Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

I was running some calculations on the Comet supercomputer using the VASP package. I am encountering an issue with respect to the memory available. The job crashes with this message in the slurm output file:

"slurmstepd: Step 17096289.0 exceeded memory limit (1074998464 > 1073741824), being killed"

I have also tried running on the large memory queue with up to 1024 GB RAM but still encounter this error. The files are present in the directory /home/ananthgr/work/hbn_nanopore_isomers/pbe/1vac/B_vac/optics in case you would like to have a look.

Could you please let me know whether this memory limit is for RAM or for disk space? Also, am I correct in thinking that the available memory as per the error message is 1073741824 bytes = 1.073 GB? If so, shouldn't this much amount be available on the nodes?

Thank you in advance for your help.

Best regards.
Ananth
