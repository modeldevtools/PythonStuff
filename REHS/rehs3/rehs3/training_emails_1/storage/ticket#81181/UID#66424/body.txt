Hi,

I'm planning to request a research allocation for Comet GPU and have questions about the storage allocation.

Could you let me know the limits of Comet GPU storage?

Also, when I requested a startup allocation for Comet GPU, I got the default storage of
SDSC Medium-term disk storage (Data Oasis): 500.0 GB
Are the default storage type and SU amount for the research allocation (for Comet GPU) same?

Best regards,
Hyun Dok
