Hello,

Will it be possible to create a shared directory on Oasis (say, /oasis/projects/nsf/mqt106/shared), where all users under the project/allocation can have read/write access?
This will simplify our workflow as all our users use same set of databases and instead of having copies of these in each users $HOME or $SCRATCH, we can keep only single copies at a common location. 

The database are made of around 380 files (including symbolic links) organized in 36 directories. Total size of the database is around 60 GB. They are read into memory in big chunks only once at the beginning of the run. They are read-only.


Thanks,
Somesh
