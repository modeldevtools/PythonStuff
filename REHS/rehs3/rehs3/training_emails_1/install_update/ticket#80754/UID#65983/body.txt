Hi Mahidhar,

I am trying to install a phonon spectrum calculation code (scph, http://www.uquantchem.com/scaild.html) on Comet. But I always have some unknown errors.
Could you pls help me compile this package on Comet or instruct me on editing the makefile?
The source code is at "/home/z9wang/bin/SCPH_SOURCE.V5/" or SCPH_SOURCE.V5.tar.gz.

Thanks,
Zhenbin
