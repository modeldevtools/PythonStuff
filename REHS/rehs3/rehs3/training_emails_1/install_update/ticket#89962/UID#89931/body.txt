Hi, 

I am working on OpenFoam simulations. I would like to post-Process some on my data using paraview. I tried to compile it by myself but there were to many libraries on the cluster that were too old to be used with the last versions of paraview. Is there a way to use paraview on the cluster ?

Thank you very much for your help.

Best, 

Alexis Marchand
