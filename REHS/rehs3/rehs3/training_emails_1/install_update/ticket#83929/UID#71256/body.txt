Hi, can you please tell me how to install (or access if it is installed somewhere) the netCDF4 module for python.  I have tried 'pip install netcdf4' and got an error about not finding mpi.h, so I loaded the mpi4py module and tried again but this time got even more errors.  netCDF4 module is pretty commonly used, so has this issue already come up before?
Thanks,
Aaron
