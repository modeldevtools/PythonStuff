Hi,

I am trying to train a neural network I have built using Keras with the Tensorflow backend in Python3. I am wanting to train on multiple Comet gpus and am having some trouble using the singularity containers. I have never used these before so please excuse my ignorance. I have found a pre-made container for Keras and Tensorflow at

/oasis/scratch/comet/mkandes/temp_project/singularity/images/keras-tensorflow-gpu.img

and this seems to have nearly everything I need except h5py. I need the python package h5py in order to save my network as a .h5 file. Is it possible to add h5py to the above container or do I need to make a new container? For either scenario can you please provide me with or point me towards some instructions on how to do so?
