Hello,

I recently got an XSEDE allocation to use the Comet supercomputer. I chose Comet because I have used it through the Neuroscience Gateway. However, when I ran "module avail", I didn't see any NEURON (neuron.yale.edu) modules. Will I need to install that myself? If so, to which directory should I install it? Thank you!
