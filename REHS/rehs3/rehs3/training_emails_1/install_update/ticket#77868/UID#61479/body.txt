I am trying to use axis=1/0 for numpy functions such as np.unique and np.all. However, the older version of the numpy on the server is not allowing me to run my code. 

Is there some way I can get away with this issue or can the numpy be updated. Is there any way I can load module for new version of numpy ? It is running on my system which has numpy 1.13.3

Thanks and regards.
