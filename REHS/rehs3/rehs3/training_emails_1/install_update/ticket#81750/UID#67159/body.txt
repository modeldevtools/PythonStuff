Hi

I'm trying to install some python packages, namely, scipy and sklearn (and all dependencies) but the system gives me an error. I was able to install some packages earlier.

Here is what I'm doing:

[gkandoi@comet-ln2 RNASeq_tissue]$ module load python
[gkandoi@comet-ln2 RNASeq_tissue]$ python --version
Python 2.7.10
[gkandoi@comet-ln2 RNASeq_tissue]$ module load lapack
[gkandoi@comet-ln2 RNASeq_tissue]$ pip install -U --user scipy

I've tried without the -U flag as well. The error is in the attached file.

Is python version 3 also available? How do I access those? When I do 'module avail' I only see python 2.7.10.
