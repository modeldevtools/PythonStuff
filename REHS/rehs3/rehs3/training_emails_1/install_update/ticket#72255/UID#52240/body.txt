I would like help setting up and learning how to use a new python environment on comet to work on a new analysis without impacting my current project.


I would like to start a new analysis that requires a different python environment than what I am currently using on Comet. I will need to install a package called gdal and I know that this package will downgrade some dependencies. On my personal machine, I do this by editing the path in ~/.bash_profile, which is not a very convinient solution.

thanks for the advice
