I am configuring some code to compile on Comet that requires the Intel MKL library.  I see that I can use the documented MKL_ROOT environment variable to point into /opt/intel/... so that the compiler command line is correct.  I have several questions though, as I am trying to make this configuration portable.

- I see also that there is a MKLROOT (no underscore) environment variable defined.  Indeed, the Intel Link Advisor (https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/intel-mkl-link-line-advisor) mentions using MKLROOT but makes no mention of the other.  Is MKLROOT legacy and deprecated on your systems or an attempt to support differences between your and Intel's documentation?

- From the perspective of portability, which of these will be a portable solution?  Are you using one or both across all of XSEDE?  Do you have any insight regarding non-XSEDE systems?  That is, is there prior art in the industry?  I realize exceptions are always possible.

- The value of ${MKL_ROOT}/lib is a directory that contains two subdirectories, intel64 and mic.  Both have shared libraries.  Should I always use the intel64 subdirectory?  Under what conditions would I use the libraries in mic?

Thanks for your help.

Cheers,
Brook
