I am trying to run parallel calculations with ORCA 4 on Comet and it looks like everything is configured correctly, but it requires a newer version of OpenMPI to work. ORCA 4 needs at least OpenMPI version 2.0.2 based on their setup information:

I think the OpenMPI version on Comet is somewhere around version 1.8. Would it be possible to upgrade OpenMPI to at least version 2.0.2?
