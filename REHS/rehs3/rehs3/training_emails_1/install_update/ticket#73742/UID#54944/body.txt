Hi,

for a set of experiments, we'll require the following software. Please advise if it can be installed on Bridges, or if it should be run in a VM. If the latter, how would we proceed?

Thanks & best,

Florian

List:

Please find below the software I require on bridges to be able to run my experiments with OpenNMT:

1) Latest version of torch installed with Lua5.2 and not with LuaJIT. Steps below are taken from http://torch.ch/docs/getting-started.html:

  - git clone https://github.com/torch/distro.git ~/torch --recursive
  - cd ~/torch; bash install-deps;
  - TORCH_LUA_VERSION=LUA52 ./install.sh

2) The package 'Luarocks'

3) Finally, using luarocks, the following modules:
Steps:
  - luarocks install image
  - luarocks install tds

The current version of torch on bridges is an old one, and it does not run with my toolkit. Also, the luarocks and tds packages are not available on bridges.
