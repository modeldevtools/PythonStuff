Hello, 
NAMD has implemented a new interface with ORCA for QM/MM calculation. Please update NAMD to it's latest version in available modules or have it custom built in my directory along with ORCA, so that I can submit a QM/MM job. They also have published their paper describing the procedure for installations. 
More information can be found here: http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/qmmm/

Thanks
-Bargeen
