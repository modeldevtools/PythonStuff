Hello,

I am a new user of the XSEDE/Comet cluster, and I would like to use it for training deep neural networks for biological applications. As a result, it is extremely important for me to have Tensorflow and Keras installed. Are there resources explaining how I can install such software/modules on Comet, and if not, can I ask an administrator to do so for me?

Thank you,

Won
