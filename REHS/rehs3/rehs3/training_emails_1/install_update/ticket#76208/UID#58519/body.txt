To whom it may concern,

So I tried to compile LLVM by myself under ~/installs/llvm with llvm source file in ~/downloads. When I used cmake to compile the llvm source, I got an error saying that Host GCC version must be at least 4.8. But when I do gcc -v I see that gcc`s version is 4.9.2. Can you help me with installing llvm 4.0.1 locally. Thank you! 



Best,
