Hi again!

My Chinese colleague has rewritten our R programs to run faster, and they now need the packages bigmemory, parallel and compiler. When I run the program, I get the messages below. One of more of the packages seem not to be available. Can you check? Thanks!

Chris

Hi, Marty and Mahidhar! It’s me again!



My colleague Bin Wang in China has made some revisions to our program, to fix a few small glitches. The revision no longer needs package ggpubr. The revised program runs fine on my computer, but when I try to run it on Comet using either RunRjob.old or RunRjob.new, I get the following mysterious error message:







Unloading compiler-dependent module mvapich2_ib/2.1



Error in -title : invalid argument to unary operator



Execution halted







I attach Bin’s revision. Really sorry about this! But I’m stuck, because I can’t replicate the error on my machine!



Best,



Chris
