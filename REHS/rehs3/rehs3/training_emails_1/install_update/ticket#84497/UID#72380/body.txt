I am trying to use the VMD installation on Comet to analyze netcdf (.nc) molecular simulations trajectory files. By default the VMD installation comes with something called the molfile plugin (http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/vmd/plugins/molfile/) that enables the software to interpret a variety of different file formats. On my local (OSX) machine, for instance, there is a file:

/Applications/VMD1.9.3.app/Contents/vmd/plugins/MACOSXX86/molfile/netcdfplugin.so

that is apparently absent (or invisible to me) on Comet. How can I install netcdf functionality onto Comet's VMD? I have attempted to perform my own custom installation, but I'm having difficulty with shared libraries (/home/tburgin/vmd/lib/vmd_LINUXAMD64: error while loading shared libraries: liboptixu.so.1: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory) that I'm unsure how to resolve.

Thanks!
