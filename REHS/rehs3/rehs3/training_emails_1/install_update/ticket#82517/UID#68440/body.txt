Hi,

I use some tools that are only supported by python 3. As a result I use anaconda in my home folder. Recently anaconda was updated to a new version and was broke. I contacted the developer and it seems they added some concurrecy feature of python which breaks conda in comet. In hindsight, it seems like a restriction imposed to the comet users. The issue is being discussed here with detail description: https://github.com/conda/conda/issues/6787

Can you please check to see if this can be resolved from your side? Or a system installed python 3 environment would help too.

Thanks.
