Hi
there would be by any chance the possibility to have the DFT software GPAW installed in Comet. GPAW is very similar to VASP, however it is open source and more importantly for Comet, it scales much more better than VASP.
Thanks in advance and best regards
Daniel
PS, I can provide you with scalability results
