We are working on a large simulation with a finite element simulation software called COMSOL and we were wondering if it is possible for us to use COMSOL at XSEDE. Could you please provide us some information about how we can install COMSOL on the server with our floating license and what else we need in order to run the simulation on the supercomputer?

Thanks,
Zhetao
