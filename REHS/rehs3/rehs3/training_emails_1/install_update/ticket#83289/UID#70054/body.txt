Hi there,

I'm highly interested in using Strelka2, a python package, in processing my sequencing data. (https://github.com/Illumina/strelka). I see that Strelka 1.0.14 is available on XSEDE but not the new version. Is there a way that Strelka2 could also be available on XSEDE? It is vastly superior to the previous one and I am certain that it will be in wide demand shortly in the scientific community. 

Thank you!
Daniela
