I'm using OpenCL on comet-gpu, mostly for GPU tasks; however, I need to use CPU as an OpenCL device. This will be just one time use for CPUs.

I assume that the comet-gpu has Intel Haswell CPUs, so there is no hardware issue.

However, I am not sure whether the system has OpenCL drivers and runtimes for Intel architecture.

When, I run CPU as an OpenCL device, the program hangs when OpenCL library is called (clGetPlatformIDs)

Could you help me on this?
