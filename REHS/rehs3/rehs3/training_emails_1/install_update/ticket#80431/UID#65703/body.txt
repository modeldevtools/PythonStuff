[Category: Software]
Note: I have another open ticket out at the moment that has nothing to do with this. It's for a different project.

I have need to install some custom files into the installation directory of Amber on Comet. I tried to simply make a copy of the /opt/amber directory to modify, but it seems that the software has been configured for Comet in some non-standard way, as the directory where I want to make changes ('$AMBERHOME/src/pmemd/src') does not exist; instead, /opt/amber/src contains only a single configuration file.

How should I go about accessing the absent files? I tried following the configuration file for clues, but it points to an installation of amber at '/state/partition1/git/amber-roll/BUILD/sdsc-amber-16/amber16' -- another directory that does not seem to exist.

The specific files I want to replace are, from the aforementioned directory, nmr_calls.F90 and nmr_lib.F90. Thanks!
