I am trying to run the Rmpfr package in R which requires mpfr. I have loaded the mpfr module, however when I attempt to install Rmpfr in R in my local R library, it throws several errors. First it cannot find the mpfr.h file. I can direct the path to this (/opt/gnu/mpfr/include/), however then it cannot find the MPFR library (which is in /opt/gnu/mpfr/lib), so the install of the package still fails.

Is there any other known way I should get MPFR running in R?

Thank you.
