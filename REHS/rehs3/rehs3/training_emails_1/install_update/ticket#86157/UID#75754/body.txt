I would like to request a new software installation. The software is widely used by Engineers and architects to simulate daylighting performance in buildings. The software is open source and is available through this link:

https://www.radiance-online.org/

The software was developed by Berkely Lab and with primary support from the U.S. Department Of Energy.
