Dear Sir/Madam,

I have been given access to Comet. I want to run Mathematica codes on Comet. Since Mathematica is not pre-installed on Comet, can I install Mathematica on it and run Mathematica codes? I have a valid license to Mathematica. I have installed Mathematica on the clusters of my university in the past and worked on it. I hope it works the same way on Comet.

Thanks for your attention!

Sincerely,
Sashwat Tanay
