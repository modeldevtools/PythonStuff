Hello,

While trying to run InterProScan on comet last week I got the following error:

bin/nucleotide/getorf: /lib64/libc.so.6: version `GLIBC_2.14' not found (required by bin/nucleotide/getorf)

Based on reports of similar errors that I found online, I believe that this may be due to comet using an older version of glibc (perhaps 2.12?), but after some poking around I was unable to find where it is installed on the system to check. Do you know which version comet is using, and if it is using version 2.14 could you tell me where it is installed so that I can make sure InterProScan is trying to access the correct location?

Thank you,

Kolbe
