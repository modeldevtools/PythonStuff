Hello, 

I'd like to install a software package that is built upon EMAN2, called SPHIRE: 

http://sphire.mpg.de/wiki/doku.php?id=downloads:sphire_beta_20170602&redirect=1

It is a CPU-based job that I want to put into my COSMIC2 science gateway. 

Is it possible to have this installed on Comet? 

Thank you,
Mike
