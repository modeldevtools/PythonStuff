Hi,
I got this error when I try to install some python package
"/lib64/libc.so.6: version `GLIBC_2.14' not found (required by /home/w6ye/.python-eggs/spglib-1.9.10.1-py2.7-linux-x86_64.egg-tmp/spglib/_spglib.so)
"

I think it is due to the GLIBC version being too old.
I ran 
"strings /lib64/libc.so.6 |grep GLIBC_"
and indeed I did not see GLIBC_2.14.

Can someone please upgrade or if I am understanding the error in the wrong way?
Thanks for your assistance.
