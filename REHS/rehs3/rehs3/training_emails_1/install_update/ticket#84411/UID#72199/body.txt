Hi,

Can you please help me installing zinbwave package on bioLite? There seems
to be a lot of updates of different packages.

source("https://bioconductor.org/biocLite.R") biocLite("zinbwave")

And the reference page is:
https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/vignettes/zinbwave/inst/doc/intro.html

Best.
