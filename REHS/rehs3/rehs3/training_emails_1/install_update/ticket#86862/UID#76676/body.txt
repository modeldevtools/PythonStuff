Hi Mahidhar:

I am trying to install MolMod software in my home directory(it is downloaded as zip file and put n the following folder):        /home/life000/quickFF/modules

The MolMod documentation states for its installing Python, GCC, Numpy, Cython, Nosetests are required. 

I am wondering the above-mentioned softwares are available in commet except GCC and Python? How can I access to them?

Best

Chao
