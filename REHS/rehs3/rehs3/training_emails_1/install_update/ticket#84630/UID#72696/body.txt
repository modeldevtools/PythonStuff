Hi
This is Chao Dong, from Dr. Manz's research group at the Department of Chemical Materials and Engineering at New Mexico State University.

We are trying to run RASPA2.0 for molecular simulation. Python 3 is used to perform the RASPA code. I am wondering if there is Python 3 available in comet system. If it is, could you let me know how to access it? If not, could you install Pyton 3 in comet system?

Best

Chao
