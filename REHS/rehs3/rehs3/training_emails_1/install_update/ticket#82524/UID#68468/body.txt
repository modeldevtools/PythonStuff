Hi,

I have two questions regarding Python and Jupyter on Comet.
First, I notice that while Jupyter offers two kernels (Python 2 and 3), regardless of what I select, my Python version is always 3 within the my Jupyter notebooks. If this is a problem on my end, please disregard this question.

Second, I want to install certain python packages that aren't available by default on Comet, but when I try to use pip or pip3 (with the -u option), the command is not found. Am I missing something/doing something wrong?

Thanks for your time!
