We are about to start python batch process on Comet, we are blocking by some unavailable python dependencies. Is there any method we could load these python libs: matplotlib, utm, math, PIL, opencv, lmfit, osgeo?

We are expecting some of these way:
1. Some particular existed module like python scipy that contain all of those requested libs.
2. We setup a running environment by installing virtualenvs ourselves.
3. link to the docker container that defines dependencies
4. Maybe other option such as Singularity.

Thanks!
