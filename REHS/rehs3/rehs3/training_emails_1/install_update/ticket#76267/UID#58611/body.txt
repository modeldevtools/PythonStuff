Hello,

My goal is to install gromacs v. 5.0.7 for running MD simulations using gromacs with cuda libraries. I loaded the cuda/8.0 and cmake module to install gromacs. However, the build failed with some interesting messages:

CMake Error at cmake/gmxTestSimd.cmake:244 (message):
  Cannot find AVX2 compiler flag.  Use a newer compiler, or choose AVX SIMD
  (slower).
Call Stack (most recent call first):
  CMakeLists.txt:729 (gmx_test_simd)

And it could not locate the gpus
-- Looking for NVIDIA GPUs present in the system
-- Could not detect NVIDIA GPUs

I logged into comet using gsissh comet from the xsede ssohub. I appreciate any guidance that you may be able to provide for the installation.

Thanks,
Arun
