Hello,

I have recently compiled and run an application on multiple(4) GPUs, which are
managed by 4 parallel Openmpi tasks. However, the behavior of the application
is not quite as expected, while on a single GPU things work fine. It appears that
the Openmpi module I have been using (openmpi_ib/2.1.2) is configured with 
Cuda 8.0, whereas the application I have been running only works on multiple 
GPUs if compiled with Cuda no later than 6.5. Would it be possible to create
another openmpi module that is configured with Cuda 6.5 with which I could compile 
and run my application?
.
