Please install singularity 2.4.2 or newer on Comet. Versions prior to that have a moderately annoying bug where certain characters in environment variables (set inside images) cause singularity to write files into the current working directory.

Here is an example of this behavior:

$ ls
$ singularity pull docker://nvidia/cuda:8.0-runtime
$ singularity exec cuda-8.0-runtime.img echo "test"
test
$ ls
=8.0  cuda-8.0-runtime.img

The =8.0 file was created because the cuda:8.0-runtime container contains the environment variable NVIDIA_REQUIRE_CUDA=cuda>=8.0. Singularity versions 2.4.2 and newer do not create the =8.0 file when running this image (or images based on this image).
