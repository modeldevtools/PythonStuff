Hi,
I want to use Rosetta for my research project and according to Rosetta I need your authorization to use this software, also I see that Rosetta isn't available in Comet and I was wondering if this could be installed, I mainly need to use one of their package called Rosetta Interface Analyzer and I think it's available starting from version 3.4. I have also obtained an academic license to use Rosetta from their website. Please let me know, if I need to provide this information to you. 
Furthermore, if granted the authorization to use Rosetta, I would like to know if there are any directory for example batch files on how to submit a Rosetta job.

Thanks
