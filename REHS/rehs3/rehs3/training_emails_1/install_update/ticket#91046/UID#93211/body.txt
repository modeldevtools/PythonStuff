Hi,

I need to modified version of vasp installed for my project, where I need to mimic
the epitaxial strain.

The file that has to be modified is constr_cell_relax.F and is attached below.
I might need to try different cell constraint. It will be great if you can let me
know how I can install locally on my account.

Regards,
Summayya
