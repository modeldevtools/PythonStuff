Hello,

       Would it be possible for a sysadmin to help me install the FHI-AIMS code on comet with HDF5?

       Here is some useful information that we've tried over the past week:  We were able to install "normal" FHI-AIMS with the intel compiler, and it works fine, but we need it to be installed with HDF5 in order to get a certain calculation to work.  The main code (and the modifications I made to the Makefile in the "src" directory) can be found here:

/home/usagi/fhi-aims.171221

...but if you want to have a fresh installation, one can also unzip the following file

/home/usagi/fhi-aims.171221.tgz

Here is what I already tried: I loaded the hdf5 module as well as the mkl library.  I also copied the Makefile.hdf5 to a new file called Makefile, and I also specified the path of hdf5 in this Makefile, however, it fails when it is specifically trying to compile specific hdf5 routines in the /home/usagi/fhi-aims.171221/src/soc directory.

Thanks,
Prof. Bryan Wong
