I am trying to compile CHASTE, a software for life sciences finite element simulations:

http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/chaste/

I have managed to get most dependencies installed in home directory using guide:

https://chaste.cs.ox.ac.uk/trac/wiki/InstallGuides/ArcCompileDependencies

However, I am running into this error below during make:

cc1plus: error: unrecognized command line option "-std=c++11"


This appears to be because gcc version in comet is old.

Can a newer version of gcc is be made available?

Thank you,
Mohammad Imtiaz
