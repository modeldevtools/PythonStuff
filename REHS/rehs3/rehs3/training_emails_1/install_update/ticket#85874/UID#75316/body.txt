Hi there,

I am trying to install the netcdf4 python module for use in post processing, but I receive an error using the command

pip2.7 install netcdf4

It seems to not know where the python hdf5 module is located, and even after i do

pip2.7 install h5py

and set the environmental variable appropriately (i think...not so sure), pip2.7 install netcdf4 does not work.

Thank you for your help!
