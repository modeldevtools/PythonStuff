The PLUMED package is installed only on Bridges? Can it be installed on Comet also? I would like to request that PLUMED be installed on Comet, if possible.  On Comet, PLUMED does not appear in the list following 'module avail' command.   I do not have access to Bridges, but I believe it is installed on Bridges according to the resources page.
