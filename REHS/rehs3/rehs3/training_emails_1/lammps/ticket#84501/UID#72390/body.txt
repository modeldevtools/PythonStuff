Hello,

I am attempting to run LAMMPS in multi-partition mode, on Comet, from the following directory:

/oasis/scratch/comet/seroot/temp_project/Aromodel/High_MW_Single_Chains/D14_48/TEMPER

According to the documentation I should be able to run 6 partitions with 1 processor per partition, using the following command:

ibrun -np 6 lammps -p 6x1 < in.TEMPER > log.TEMPER

Unfortunately, I am getting an MPI error as specified in: job.14636566.comet-05-40.out

Do you know of anyone successfully using multi-partition mode with Comet? Any idea what is causing this error? Any assistance would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you,
Sam
