Hello,

I am attempting to run single-node, multi-core jobs on the shared partition. I have been attempting to use mpirun to accomplish this goal; however, when I use mpirun, I notice that my simulation output is not completely written, but it is cut off at approximately 98% of my total expected output. (if I run a test simulation on my local desk machine with mpirun I do not have this problem)
I am running a LAMMPS job.

My slurm script is attached.

Should I be running my job with another command?
Could you please help me solve this issue?

Best,

Brandon Horan
