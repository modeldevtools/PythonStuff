To Whom It May Concern:

I would like to run LAMMPS on Comet but am receiving several errors, despite modeling my script after the example. I have attached my input and error files, which are also located in folder2 in my home directory. Could you please explain the source of these errors? Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you,
Brooklyn Noble
