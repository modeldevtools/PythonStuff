Hi,

I have a problem when running LAMMPS. I didn't find any output files but the jobs are still running. I found that the version for LAMMPS is updated to 20170331. So I put 'module load lammps/20170331' in the batch script. Could you help me find what the problem is? My directory is /oasis/projects/nsf/rut133/ty121/Desorption_wall_4.0_A12_0.2.

Thank you!

Best,
Tianya
