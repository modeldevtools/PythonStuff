Hello Comet, 

I am needing to compile LAMMPS with openMPI for compatibility testing. However, I am receiving the error:

PMI2 failed to initialize, returning an error code of 14.

upon running the successfully built executable. I saw on a blog thread that this was an issue on Comet for Gromacs at one point. Was this ever resolved?

Thanks,

Jake
