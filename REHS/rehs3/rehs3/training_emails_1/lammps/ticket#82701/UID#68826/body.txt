Dear Sir,

I was able to run LAMMPS on Comet in September 2017. I tried to run LAMMPS today but it did not work. To confirm it was not my simulation problems, I tried to run a simulation which had no problem running in September 2017 but it still failed. I used exactly the same job file and input files. I attached my job file and output error messages. Thanks much for your help.
