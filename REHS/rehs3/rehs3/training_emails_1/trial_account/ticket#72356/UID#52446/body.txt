Hi,

This is Ashish Venkat, a graduate student of Prof. Dean Tullsen at UCSD.  We're conducting research on custom instruction set designs, which requires simulating a large search space of different ISA and micro-architectural characteristics that result in 7500 CPU configurations and a simulation effort of 10,000 CPU hours.  We believe SDSC's comet infrastructure could help cut down our simulation effort from months to a few days and would like to profile some of our applications on the cluster before submitting a full startup grant.  We'd appreciate your help in setting up this trial account.

Thanks,
Ashish
