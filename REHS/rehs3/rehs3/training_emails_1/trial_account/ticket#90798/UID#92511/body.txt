[System: Comet]
[Category: Trial Account]
I'm a postdoctoral researcher at the Institute for Neural Computation (INC) at UCSD. My advisor is Terrence Sejnowski. Together, we are studying a computational model of spiking neural network dynamics. We have implemented this model in C (no dependencies) and have tested it extensively on our local cluster. Trial access to Comet would allow us to investigate this model at the precision necessary to understand the complex scaling relationships at different network sizes.
