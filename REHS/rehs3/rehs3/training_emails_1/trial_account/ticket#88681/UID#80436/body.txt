Dear Help desk, 

I had a trial allocation once on comet, but never used it. Id like to test if I can run an atmospheric general circulation model on comet. Can I get a new trail allocation? Once it works, me and my advisor with submit a allocation proposal. 

If you think another xsede cluster might more appropriate, I'm happy to change to that.

best
