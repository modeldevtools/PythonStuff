Hello,

I am Munseob Lee, an Assistant Professor at UCSD. May I ask the trial allocation for me and a graduate student? My id is munseob and her id is odenisla. The best case will be having a joint access to the same server space so that we could work together in real time. Please let me know if you need any further information.
