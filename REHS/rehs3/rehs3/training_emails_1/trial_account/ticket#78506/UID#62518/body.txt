Hi,

I will like to request an account to run some energy calculation using some quantum chemistry software e.i Gaussian, Molpro, Orca, etc. Since my goal is first to test the methodology and find the best compromise between accuracy and computational efficiency for this I will like to run a set of several medium and large representative molecules using different solvent schemes. Therefore for some molecules, I would like to use a large amount of core memory and GPUs.  I was wondering if you could suggest me what could be the optimal number of service units, PSC Storage, and  GPU-hours in Bridges I should request.  

Thanks
Hector H. Corzo
