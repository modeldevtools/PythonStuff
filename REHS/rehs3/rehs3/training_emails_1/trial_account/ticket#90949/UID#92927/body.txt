Hello,

We are preparing to submit a research allocation request for comet GPU's to run molecular dynamics simulations on protein water systems consisting of ~ 44000 atoms, using gromacs. We have a total of 28 protein water systems with a similar size. That being said, we would like request a trial allocation of comet gpu resources to run short 100 picosecond simulations of the 28 protein water systems to get stable timings for their scaling.

Regards,
Jermel
