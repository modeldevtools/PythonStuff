[Category: Allocations]
My name is Shaoyi Zhang. I'm a intern at the Clicc project, UC Santa Barbara. Currently, I'm awaiting my supervisor and PI to get research allocation. I'm wondering if I can get a trial allocation so that I can familiar myself with XSEDE and Comet before the the research allocation is available.
