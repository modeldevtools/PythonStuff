Title: Scalable deep learning methods to interrogate neural dynamics
Primary field of science: Neuroscience
Abstract:
Our research centers around understanding how thoughts and actions are represented by the brain. The ultimate goal of this project is to build direct "brain-machine interface" systems for people with spinal cord injury and other forms of paralysis. By working to understand their thoughts, we can create devices that can understand their intention to move, and ultimately move their own limbs using exoskeletons or direct electrical stimulation of their muscles.

We recently developed novel deep learning algorithms that allow us to understand thoughts with unprecedented accuracy [1]. While their initial performance has set a new state-of-the art, we believe performance can be dramatically improved through a process known as hyperparameter optimization. We aim to extend our algorithms to perform large-scale hyperparameter optimization using Population Based Training of Neural Networks [2,3]. This optimization process involves training many (hundreds to thousands) of deep learning models, and using a genetic algorithm approach to choose the best hyperparameters and iteratively refine them. To this end, we would like to leverage XSEDE GPU cluster resources to test new methods of hyperparameter optimization and continue to enhance the performance of our algorithms, such that they might restore quality function for people with paralysis.
