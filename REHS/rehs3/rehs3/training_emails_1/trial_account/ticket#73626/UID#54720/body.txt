[Ticket created from XUP by enijkamp]
[From: Erik Nijkamp]
[System: Comet]
[Category: Trial Account]
Dear XSede,

I would like to request a trial account on SDSC Comet to evaluate the system for a startup allocation proposal.

If possible, could we get trial access to both comet and comet-gpu?

Thank you.

Best regards,
 Erik Nijkamp
