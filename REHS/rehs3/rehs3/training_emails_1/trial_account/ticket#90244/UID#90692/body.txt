Hello,
I think that the Lazaridis Lab was awarded a trial account for 100 GPU core-hours on COMET.  I have not been granted access to these resources as far as I can tell, and My XSEDE states that, "No active projects were found for this account."  Any advice would be greatly appreciated.
All the best,
