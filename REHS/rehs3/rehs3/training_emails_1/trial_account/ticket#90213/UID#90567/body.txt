[System: Comet]
[Category: Trial Account]
According to https://portal.xsede.org/allocations/startup Comet allows Trial Allocations. With the results of one initial analysis of the performance of the C++ program the decision to move forward to a startup allocation will be made.

The C++ program is a genetic algorithm (GA) that makes use, at the moment, of the library openmpi, boost, and GSL. I believe the required libraries are very common, most likely already being available in the modules of Comet.
