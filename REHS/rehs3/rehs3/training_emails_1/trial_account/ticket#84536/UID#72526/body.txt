Hello,

I would like to test the Comet cluster for simulations I am running, so that I can better understand the type/amount of resources needed when I apply for a Startup Allocation.

I am a graduate student at the University of Michigan-Ann Arbor, Dept. of Astronomy

Please let me know if there is any other info needed

Thank you
