Dear Madam/Sir

I am third-year CS PhD student at the University of Utah. Our group have designed a tool for efficiently collecting execution traces from large-scale MPI applications. My PIs are working on a proposal to request some allocation but before that, I wanted to request a trial account on Comet and test a few jobs to see how suitable the available resources are for our purposes. 
My jobs would run our trace collection tool - which is designed based on Pin (from Intel) -
 on top of native execution of some common benchmarks like NAS (NPB).
Please let me know if you have any further questions.

Regards,
Saeed Taheri
