[Category: Trial Account]
I am a Masterâ€™s student at California State University, Long Beach. I am requesting a trial allocation account with GPU access in order to work on my research project on convolutional neural networks for the classification of land-use images. The purpose of my project is to explore different network architectures to improve classification of images in the UC Merced land-use dataset. This dataset consists of 21 classes of images, with 100 images per class. I have developed a network in PyTorch for classifying 8 of the classes, which takes about 30 minutes to run on a laptop. I am requesting the trial allocation in order to extend the classifier to all 21 classes, and to experiment in converting the PyTorch code for use with a GPU. Please let me know if it would be possible to obtain a trial allocation with access to a GPU, and with the use Torch and Python/PyTorch software. Thank you.
