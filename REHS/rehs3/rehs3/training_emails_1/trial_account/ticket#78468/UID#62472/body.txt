Hi,

I am a graduate student in physics at UCSD. Our lab need to receive TB scale data from Argonne national lab. I heard that there are a high speed data transfer wire between building within UCSD and SDSC? Could you tell me if itâ€™s possible to receive data from Argonne to SDSC first and then transfer the data within campus from SDSC to Urey Hall/ Mayer hall? If yes, could you tell me the expected data transfer rate and how to apply for the data transfer through SDSC? 

Thank you!

Best regards,
Xiang
