Hi,

I am a phd student from Center for Vision, Cognition, Learning, and Autonomy (VCLA) in UCLA. My research interest is generative modeling using CNN structures. I'm writing to request trial allocations, and I was wondering if I can access GPU resources on Comet.

Looking forward to your reply. Thank you!
