The objective of this research is to investigate the impacts of the Kardi-Parisi-Zhang equation on the steady state configuration of an already existing dissolution model. The model has been updated to incorporate KPZ, but our current resources lack the computing power needed to efficiently study the system. Further investigation with increased computing power will allow us to conclude whether or not the dissolution model is part of the KPZ universality class, and if the effective KPZ exponents can be calculated. These conclusions will allow for a better understanding of the stochastic processes involved in mineral dissolution. To continue this research we request a trial use of the Comet System. We plan to run a python script to perform Monte-Carlo simulations of mineral dissolution kinetics. The output of the script will involve an array of surface width vs. time plots, as well as an array of surface height at specific times.
