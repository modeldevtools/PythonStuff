Dear XSEDE Support Team,

My name is Matt Childers and I am writing to ask about a trial allocation on Comet. I am the allocation manager and TA for Valerie Daggett's computational protein design course. Our group has an educational XSEDE allocation associated with this course called "BIOEN 588 Computational Protein Design" with allocation ID TG-MCB160195 (currently inactive).

In the past, students have used Stampede for this course, and we would like to use Comet going forward. Before submitting an allocation request, I would like to test our software on Comet to determine our resource requirements. I have not able to submit a startup request via XRAS (see attachment). Please let me know if it is possible to lift this restriction. I would need a small number of SUs (~2500) for this trial.

best, 

Matt
