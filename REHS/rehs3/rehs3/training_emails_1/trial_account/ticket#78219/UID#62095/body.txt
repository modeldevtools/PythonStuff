Dear Sir/Madam,

I'm a PhD student in NC State University, and I'm currently using ANSYS FLUENT for my research on flow inside porous media. I'm planning on running a Large Eddy Simulation after some verification work I'm doing right now, which would very likely need much more computational resource then what I have right now.

I'm now trying to find more computational resources, and I would like to apply for a trial account just to try out how to use ANSYS on this system, is this doable?

Thank you.

Best,
Ching-Wei Huang
