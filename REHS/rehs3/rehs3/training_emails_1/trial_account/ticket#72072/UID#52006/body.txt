[From: Jaime Ashander]
[System: Comet]
[Category: Trial Account]
I am working on a computational project at UCLA which involves many core hours of forward simulations to parameterize a population model. I'm requesting a trial allocation to evaluate whether Comet will work for our needs. If it does I will put in a full Startup or Research allocation.
