[From: Phillip Lotshaw]
[System: Comet]
[Category: Trial Account]
Dear colleague,

I would like to request access to a trial allocation on the Comet cluster to assess the suitability of Comet for large parallel computations I'm performing for my PhD research at the University of Oregon.

I have questions about the amounts of resources available for the trial and startup allocations.  On the website

https://portal.xsede.org/allocations/startup

I see in the table that Comet has the service unit limit of 50,000 core-hours for startup accounts.  Below it says that trial accounts give 1,000 SUs for 6 months.  Does this mean that with a trial account I would have access to 1000 x (50,000 core-hours) = 5x10^8 core-hours?  If so, does the service limit = the amount available for one job, or something else?  How many core-hours and what size jobs does a startup allocation have access to?  

Thank you very much for your time,
Phillip Lotshaw
