Dear admin,
Hi! My name is Jiaheng Tang and I'm a new graduate student in the ECE department. I'm currently taking CS 240A-Applied Parallel Computing with Prof. Yang. One of the homework problems requires us to port the code to Comet with the Intel MKL library, so I'd like to request a trial account for using comet cluster. If you need anything else from me, please let me know.

My XSEDE account name is zedtang, thank you!

Best,
Jiaheng
