Hello,

I've been trying to begin a student trial version of getting access to
Comet but I feel that the links that say "Begin Trial Version" Or apply
send me to a dead end.

I've created a XSEDE account online and I'm wondering if you could point me
in the right direction.

Thanks!

Best,

Ryan Hillary
