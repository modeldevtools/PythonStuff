I am a graduate student needing a platform to test molecular dynamics simulations of grain growth. I am in the process of applying for an XSEDE startup allocation, but was hoping to obtain a trial allocation on commet so that I can begin familiarizing myself with XSEDE resources as well as begin running some of my smaller jobs in the mean time.
