[System: Comet]
[Category: Trial Account]
I am requesting an extended trial of the Comet. Six-month trial has passed much more quickly than I thought. If you could track my usage, it would be none until recently. Currently, my research project just comes to a point where I need a powerful computing resource like Comet. It will be great if I could try Comet for my computing need so that I can decide if I will need it for my future gradute studies. I will appreciate it if you would issue me another six-month trial considering that I didn't take up any computing power during my previous trial.

Thank you!
