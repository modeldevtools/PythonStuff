[Ticket created from XUP by astwand]
[From: Wanda Feng]
[System: Comet]
[Category: Allocations]
Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Wanda Feng, and I am an NSF Fellow in astrophysics at Arizona State University. 

I understand that NSF Fellows may serve as PIs on XSEDE time allocation requests. I do plan to submit a request, but I am hoping to test my code on Comet first. Under the trial allocation portion of your website, there is a note to create an account and submit a ticket to the help desk for a trial allocation. Can you help me proceed with this?

Thank you for your time!


Yours sincerely,
Wanda Feng
