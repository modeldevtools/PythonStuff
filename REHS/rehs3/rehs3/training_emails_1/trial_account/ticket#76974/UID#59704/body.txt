[System: Comet]
[Category: Trial Account]
We are exploring an AMR data set  with volume rendering software written specifically for it and would like to see how this works on Comet as well as exploit globus_url_copy transfer.  Data files are 40-143GB for exploration, but room for a subset (a few) of files for trials would be sufficient.  No GPU nodes are needed or wanted.

Upfront, I had a comet trial allocation two years ago (many thanks!), and rendering went well on Comet nodes as well as Flash runs.  This is a different kind of problem, however, much different data.  I think that Comet is ideal for this kind of data exploration, quick if modest distributed runs with results out in a few minutes, hopefully seconds.  That is what needs to be confirmed.

I understand that 1 day may be sufficient for this .  A startup would take longer, and it is best to be make sure first with some modest testing.
