Hello,

I am a postdoctoral researcher at UC Davis in need of compute systems with high performance GPUs and a large number of accompanying compute threads to run benchmarking experiments.  Towards this end, I'm writing to request a trial account on the Comet GPU system.  Please let me know if any additional information is required.

Best regards,
John T. Halloran
