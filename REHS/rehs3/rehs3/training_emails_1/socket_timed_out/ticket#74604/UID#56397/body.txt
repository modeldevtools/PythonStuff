Hello,

It currently takes a long time to interact with the queue system on Comet (login node 3 if that makes a difference). The "qstat" command takes around a minute (wall time) to run. Here's the output of "time qstat -u jrd101":
real    0m58.086s
user    0m0.214s
sys     0m0.015s

And here's the timing of the "qdel" command:
real    0m56.690s
user    0m0.024s
sys     0m0.009s


And submitting jobs via "sbatch" takes at least that amount of time if not longer, to the point where I actually got several timeout messages for some of the jobs I submitted today (after 1 minute 30 seconds had passed in those cases):
"sbatch: error: slurm_receive_msg: Socket timed out on send/recv operation
sbatch: error: Batch job submission failed: Socket timed out on send/recv operation"

Performing other tasks (using Vim, running Python scripts, etc) is very responsive and has no appreciable delay. It's only interacting with the queue system where this occurs.
