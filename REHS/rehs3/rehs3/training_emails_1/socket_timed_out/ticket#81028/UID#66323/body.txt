Hi Mahidhar,

When I submit jobs on Comet, the follow error occurs:

[z9wang@comet-ln2 Sr3L31Al31O9-1]$ sbatch submit_script 
sbatch: error: slurm_receive_msg: Socket timed out on send/recv operation
sbatch: error: Batch job submission failed: Socket timed out on send/recv operation

I think the Slurm job manager is dead. Could you pls fix it?

Also, I have a quick question on the charging of jobs running on the partition of "shared" and "compute" node. Does a job running on compute node with 12cores charge the same as that running on a shared node?

Thanks,
Zhenbin
