Hello,

I was trying to submit a job to Comet and I got the following error: 
$ sbatch batch_command.run 
sbatch: error: slurm_receive_msg: Socket timed out on send/recv operation
sbatch: error: Batch job submission failed: Socket timed out on send/recv operation

Is this due to SLURM or my submission script? I'm thinking SLURM since squeue isn't working for me either. 

Mike
