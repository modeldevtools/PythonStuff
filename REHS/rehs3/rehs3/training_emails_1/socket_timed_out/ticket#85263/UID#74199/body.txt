Hi, I cannot access the queue or submit jobs on comet. When I submit my script, I get the error message
"
batch: error: slurm_receive_msg: Socket timed out on send/recv operation
sbatch: error: Batch job submission failed: Socket timed out on send/recv operation
"
Not sure if this is a global or local issue?
Thanks, Inga
