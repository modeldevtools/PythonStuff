Hello, 

I' m experiencing an error with job submission and inquiry on Comet. 
The error shows: 
"sbatch: error: slurm_receive_msg: Socket timed out on send/recv operation
sbatch: error: Batch job submission failed: Socket timed out on send/recv operation"

Can you help take a look and locate the problem ?

Thanks,
