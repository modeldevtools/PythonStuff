Hi, this is Peizhi. When I try to either submit a new job or check current job status in comet, it shows 
sbatch: error: slurm_receive_msg: Socket timed out on send/recv operation
sbatch: error: Batch job submission failed: Socket timed out on send/recv operation

Could you please  help me with that?

Best,
Peizhi
