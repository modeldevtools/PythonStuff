Hi, I got the following error message several times when submitting job:

Message from qsub:
There was an error running the SLURM sbatch command.
The command was:
'/usr/bin/sbatch /oasis/scratch/comet/liuqian/temp_project/output/GOM/autorun/out/20170807T145645/gom_20170807T145645_0001runfile.sh  2>&1'
and the output was:
'sbatch: error: slurm_receive_msg: Socket timed out on send/recv operation
 sbatch: error: Batch job submission failed: Socket timed out on send/recv operation

Sometimes when I re-submit the job, it works again.  Is the problem associated with the cluster or is there anything wrong with the sh file?

Thank you!
Liuqian
