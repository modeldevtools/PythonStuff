Hello,

Throughout today and yesterday, I have been receiving timeout issues when submitting my jobs to the shared queue:

sbatch: error: slurm_receive_msg: Socket timed out on send/recv operation
sbatch: error: Batch job submission failed: Socket timed out on send/recv operation

The submission script parameters for slurm are:
#!/bin/bash
#SBATCH -p shared
#SBATCH --nodes=1
#SBATCH --ntasks-per-node=1
#SBATCH --mem=32G
#SBATCH -t 00:20:00
#SBATCH -J compile_wps 
#SBATCH -o compile_wps.%j.%N.out
#SBATCH -e compile_wps.%j.%N.err
#SBATCH --export=ALL

Thanks,
Rachel Weihs
