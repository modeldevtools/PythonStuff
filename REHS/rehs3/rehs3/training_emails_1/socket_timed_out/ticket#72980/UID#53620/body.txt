Dear XSEDE SUPPORT,

I have problem submitting jobs on Comet:

sbatch: error: slurm_receive_msg: Socket timed out on send/recv operation
sbatch: error: Batch job submission failed: Socket timed out on send/recv operation

My working dir is /oasis/projects/nsf/chi128/cliao2/work/pac1r_Gs_2/charmm-gui/gmx_run2/run 

I appreciate your help in advance.

Best,
Chenyi
