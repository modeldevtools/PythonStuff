Hi,

I am trying to submit a job on comet using slurm command "sbatch job.sb" but I get the following
error message "sbatch: error: slurm_receive_msg: Socket timed out on send/recv operation
sbatch: error: Batch job submission failed: Socket timed out on send/recv operation"

I am wondering if I am missing anything here.

Regards
Phani
