Hello,

Sorry for the newbie question but I haven't used comet before. I am trying
to submit the following job that used to work fine when we were on Gordon
and Trestles. I thought I had changed everything in the script from #pbs to
the appropriate #sbatch option but I am sure I am missing something.
Below is the error and attached are the three different scripts I tried.

thanks,
Rob

[rmorey@comet-ln3 Winter2018]$ sbatch star_RRM18_sbatch.pbs
sbatch: error: slurm_receive_msg: Socket timed out on send/recv operation
sbatch: error: Batch job submission failed: Socket timed out on send/recv
operation
