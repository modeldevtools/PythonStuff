Hi, I would like to report that the SLURM queuing system on Comet is not responding. When I type "squeue -u pstlaure" then I get: "squeue: error: slurm_receive_msg: Socket timed out on send/recv operation
slurm_load_jobs error: Socket timed out on send/recv operation"
Thank you for your help, Pierre (username pstlaure)
