[System: Comet]
[Category: Batch Queues/Jobs]
Regards,
I have submitted a job but I get the following error:
sbatch: error: slurm_receive_msg: Socket timed out on send/recv operation
sbatch: error: Batch job submission failed: Socket timed out on send/recv operation

Is there a problem with Comet today?

I submitted this job before and it queued properly before quiting because of a syntax error in my input script. I resubmitted today but got such error.

If you can help with this I will appreciate it 
Bests
