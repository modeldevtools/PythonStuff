Hi,

I am having difficulty with submitting jobs on comet.
I am receiving the following error message:

sbatch: error: slurm_receive_msg: Socket timed out on send/recv operation
sbatch: error: Batch job submission failed: Socket timed out on send/recv operation

If you can help me with this, I really appreciate it.

Thank you
Madhavan
