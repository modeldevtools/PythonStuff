Hello, 

I am a graduate student in Chemical Engineering at MIT and have an account in Comet to carry out computational research funded through the XSEDE program. I looked at the Comet website and found out that the maximum number of regular compute nodes which can be used by an user at any time is 72. Is it possible that I can request to increase this from 72 to 120 in my case for a few days (possibly till the end of this week)? I need this temporary increase in the nodes to generate some quick results on a project that I am working on. My username in the XSEDE system is "rpmisra". 

Thanks a lot in advance.

Best regards,
Rahul
