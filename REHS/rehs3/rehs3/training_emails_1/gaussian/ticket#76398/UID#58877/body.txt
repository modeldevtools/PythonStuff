I would like to add new users able to share my current allocation with me. I have nine students which I would like to train on basics of running Gaussian computations at xsede.
Please, let me know instructions how to do it, so that all students will be able to share their directories with me and vice versa. If I am not allowed to create new user accounts, could you create it for me? I will supply their emails.
thank you,
Alexey Ignatchenko.
