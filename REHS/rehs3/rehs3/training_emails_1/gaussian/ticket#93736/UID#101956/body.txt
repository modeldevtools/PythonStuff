Hello,

I am working with Gaussian 09, and the jobs will be terminated quickly. 
It seems that the reason is the input files. I made them in the Mac (avogadro) or windows (gaussview). I do not have this problem with the cluster of our university.
Is there any way to run the same input file on comet. I do not have access to a visualization software on the Linux to use that. 

Thank you,
Saber
