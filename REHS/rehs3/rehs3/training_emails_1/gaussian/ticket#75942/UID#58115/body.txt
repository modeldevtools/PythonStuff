Hello,

      Two of the members in my allocation would like to run small one-node jobs that may take a week (specifically using the single-node Gaussian program or the single-node DFTB).

       Would it be possible to enable their accounts so that they can use the "oneweek" queue?  Their usernames are "faquino" and "ysun022" (cc'ed in this e-mail also).
