Hello,

In project mcp101, we teach students to run gaussian simulations. Could you add the following accounts to gaussian group so that they have access to the software? The accounts are:
echon1 (Erica Chong Ng)
sbova1 (Samantha Bova)
mgiolito (Mitthew Giolito)
awali1 (Aayush Walia)

Please let me know if you need any other information. Thanks a lot!!

Best,
Li
