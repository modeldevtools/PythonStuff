Mahidhar:
  My student Edward wrote you about a Gaussian utility called formchk.  It takes a .chk file and converts it to a readable format.  I cannot find the batch files that will invoke this utility.  There are examples of batch files in /share/apps/examples/GAUSSIAN, but not for formchk.  Do you know of a Gaussian expert who I could contact to ask about how to do this?
  Regards, Dave Close
