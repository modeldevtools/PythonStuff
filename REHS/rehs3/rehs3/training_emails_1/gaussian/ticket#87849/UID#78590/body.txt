Hi,

Our group has some issues with Gaussian software during last weekend and today. All Gaussian jobs submitted to Comet runs for a while but then fails with the same error(Convergence failure -- run terminated). And this error shows up for many types of calculation(optimization, single points...). One output file is attached.

It seems like it's something wrong with Gaussian on Comet. Is it possible to fix it for us?
We really appreciate your help!
