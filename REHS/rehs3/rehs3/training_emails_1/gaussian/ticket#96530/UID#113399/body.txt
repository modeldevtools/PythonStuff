I received this email from my Advisor,
"You will also want to send a help desk ticket (help tab) for the "Comet" system" and state you need to be added to the "Gaussian group" in the problem description.  You can reference me as your adviser, and my e-mail (jlyon10@kennesaw.edu) if they have any questions."
