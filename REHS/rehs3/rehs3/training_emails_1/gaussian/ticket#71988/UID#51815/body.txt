Dear all,

I am trying to use the Gaussian accelerated MD (GaMD) method implemented in AMBER 16 on the GPU nodes of COMET.
But I get this error:

Unloading compiler-dependent module mvapich2_ib/2.1
cudaMemcpy GpuBuffer::Download failed an illegal memory access was encountered


Can you please help me in solving this issue? 

Thank you
Giulia
