Hello

I would like to submit Gaussian jobs to Comet, however I'm getting an error when I submit jobs of 
no g09 in (/opt/gaussian/....
which arises after running "which g09"

which suggests to me that I don't have access to Gaussian on my account? Could you please assist me in getting access to this software.

Many thanks
Best wishes
Kealan
