Hello!
I was recently added to a research project by a professor (I am a student) using the Comet resource, and I am wondering what is required of me in order to gain access to the software Gaussian. It was mentioned to me that I might be required to fill out some forms in order to get access, but am unsure where to find this.

Thanks for your time!
