Dear Sir/Madam,

I have a trial account before and was added in the Gaussian group. Now since I upgrade to the Startup account, I wonder if I am still be able to use Gaussian, or if you need to add me in the group again? 
Also if I add another user to my account, will he be able to use Gaussian as well, and how? Will there be any change in the directory we type in when we work?

Thank you,
Phuong
