My fortran trajectory code (compiled with /opt/mvapich2/intel/ib/bin/mpif90) 
invokes Gaussian 16 in a “call system” statement, which executes a shell script, 
run_g16, that invokes g16. It works well, except for my student Amrita (user 
name aks2213). The problem in her case is that after the successful completion 
of all statements in run_g16, the “call system” statement does not procede to 
the next fortran statement. The job continues to be listed as running in squeue, 
but no further output is produced. This happens only for Amrita, not for me or 
my other students. Any ideas on what the problem could be, or how to debug it or 
to avoid it? For example, is there a better way to execute run_g16 from within a 
fortran program?

Many thanks,
Chuck Doubleday
