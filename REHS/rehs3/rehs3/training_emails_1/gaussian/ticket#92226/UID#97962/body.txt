Dear Help Desk Office of XSEDE,

I am trying to submit a job for a Gaussian software. I am using the script that is located in /home/selb/bin/qg09.comet . However, once the job starts, it is unable to locate Gaussian in the system.

I am thinking it is because I am not part of Gaussian group (ie. upon "groups" keyword, I only see "cla105" but I am supposed to see "gaussian" as well but it is missing). Would it be possible to add me to Gaussian group please? Or if there is anything I need to provide, please let me know.

Thank you in advance for your time and assistance,
Best wishes,
Selbi
