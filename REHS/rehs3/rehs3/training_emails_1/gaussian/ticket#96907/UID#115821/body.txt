Hi there, I'm a student doing research with Dr. Erin Speetzen and when I try to submit my files they aren't going through on the system. She told me it's probably because I haven't been added to the Gaussian system on Comet just yet and I was hoping to gain this access soon! 

Thanks and have a great weekend.
