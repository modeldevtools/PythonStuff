Hello

I reached out for some help installing ffmpeg in back in December 2016, and the solution we settled on was that I would use Jerry Greenberg's ffmpeg that was located at:
/home/jpg/opt/comet/ffmpeg/bin/

It seems like this has moved. Maybe to:
/home/jpg/cometscratch/ffmpeg/ffmpeg-2.8

But I do not have access to that. Using ffmpeg is a big part of my work flow, so if you could assist me in installing my own version or making one available to me that would be great.

thanks!
Drummond
