Hello,

I am trying to run Gaussian jobs on Comet, using the .sb submission files given on Comet in 
/share/apps/examples/GAUSSIAN
However, Gaussian cannot be started and the output from the queue system indicates
which: no g09 in 
followed by a list of directories it is checking.

My guess is, I need a permission to run Gaussian that I don't have. I could not find any information regarding where to turn to obtain this, or even if it is necessary on both the XSEDE and Comet websites. Can you please point me to the right adress or help me otherwise if this is not the problem?

Thank you,
Tobias Gensch
