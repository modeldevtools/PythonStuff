I tried to run a job using Gaussian (g16) on Comet and got the following error:
/usr/bin/time: cannot run g16: Permission denied
0.00user 0.00system 0:03.03elapsed 0%CPU (0avgtext+0avgdata 260maxresident)k
1336inputs+8outputs (0major+53minor)pagefaults 0swaps

How can I get permission to use g16?

Thanks!
