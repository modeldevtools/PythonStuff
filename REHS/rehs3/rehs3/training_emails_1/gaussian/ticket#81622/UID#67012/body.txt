Hello,


My name is Sarah Dutton, and I'm an undergraduate student working with Professor Dean Tantillo.


Professor Tantillo recently received grant allocation of resources on Comet which I would like to take advantage of. In order to do so, I need to use Gaussian on Comet. May I please be granted permission to do so?


Thank you!

Sarah Dutton
