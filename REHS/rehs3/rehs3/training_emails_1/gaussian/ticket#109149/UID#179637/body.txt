I am using a  start-up allocation on Comet to prepare a later education submission to be used  Fall 2019 semester. I am currently running jobs using Gaussian.   Especially, because these will ultimately be reproduced by undergraduates as part of a course, it would be really helpful if we could use its counterpart GaussianView for visualization, and data analysis. While GaussianView software is installed on Comet, I am not able to use it.  I recieve the error, "E233: cannot open display".  Does Comet have any visualization nodes? What would be my options, at this stage, for getting access to something along those lines? Thank you very much. Ana
