I am given access to comet but I cannot submit jobs. I need to be added to the gaussian group for access. 

Below is the error message:
[glee16@comet-ln2 ~]$ ~/bin/qg09.comet 20_endo.com
-bash: /home/glee16/bin/qg09.comet: Permission denied

Below is the result that I get after typing "groups":
[glee16@comet-ln2 ~]$ groups
