Hello: 

there seem to be a problem with Gaussian: it is not available after doing "module load gaussian/16.B.01": 

$ g16
-bash: g16: command not found

When I attempt to ls /opt/gaussian there's an error:
ls: cannot open directory /opt/gaussian: Too many levels of symbolic links 

(a file system problem?) 

Thanks,
-Qadir
