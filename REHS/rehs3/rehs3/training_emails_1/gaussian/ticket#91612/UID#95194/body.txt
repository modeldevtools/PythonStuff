Hello, 

I am new to XSEDE and have been having issues with my script for the submission of a test job using Gaussian 09.   I found the example files, but apparently I am just not understanding the script because my jobs continue to fail. Here is the example script provided for submission to comet: 

#!/bin/bash
#SBATCH --job-name="gauss"
#SBATCH --output="gauss.%j.%N.out"
#SBATCH --partition=debug
#SBATCH --nodes=1
#SBATCH --ntasks-per-node=24
#SBATCH --export=ALL
#SBATCH -t 00:10:00
export GAUSS_SCRDIR=/scratch/$USER/$SLURM_JOBID
module load gaussian
exe=`which g09`
/usr/bin/time $exe < water_opt_24c.dat > water_opt_09D.out

If I am submitting this script that references my Gaussian input file (test.dat), how would you edit this script to get output in test.out?
