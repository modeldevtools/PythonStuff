Hello,
I am trying to run Gaussian on comet and I have the example slurm script and tried running that but I got error saying that there is no g16 in my path. I have tried commands independently such as: 
module load gaussian/16.A.03
module load gaussian/09.D.01

The modules show up under the modules list and the path; 
/usr/bin/which: no g16 in (/opt/gaussian/16.A.03/g16:

I have also tried the command: 
source /etc/profile.d/modules.sh

But these command does not help. Please let me know if I am missing a step or how to resolve this issue.

Thank you very much
Kiran
