Hi,

I'm a postdoc at TSRI collaborating with Prof. Peng Liu and he provided me access to the XSEDE portal to run calculations using Gaussian in bridges and comet. My username is 'mkarun'.

I've filled the form at:
https://www.psc.edu/index.php/user-resources/software/gaussian/permission-form?view=form

and I already have access to Gaussian in 'bridges'. Could you please allow me to have access to Gaussian in 'comet' as well?  I tried to run calculations in comet in gaussian.. But, they seem to error out..  Thank you..

Best,
