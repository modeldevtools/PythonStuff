Hello, 

I am trying to run a gaussian job on COMET using the example job scripts provided in the shared folder. When I try to run the job (after checking the correct module was loaded) I receive this error in my .out file:

which: no g16 in (/opt/gaussian/16.A.03/g16:/opt/gnu/gcc/bin:/opt/gnu/bin:/opt/mvapich2/intel/ib/bin:/opt/intel/composer_xe_2013_sp1.2.144/bin/intel64:/opt/intel/composer_xe_2013_sp1.2.144/mpirt/bin/intel64:/opt/intel/composer_xe_2013_sp1.2.144/debugger/gdb/intel64_mic/bin:/usr/lib64/qt-3.3/bin:/usr/local/bin:/bin:/usr/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/opt/ibutils/bin:/usr/java/latest/bin:/opt/pdsh/bin:/opt/rocks/bin:/opt/rocks/sbin:/opt/sdsc/bin:/opt/sdsc/sbin:/home/lanichem/bin)
Usage: /usr/bin/time [-apvV] [-f format] [-o file] [--append] [--verbose]
       [--portability] [--format=format] [--output=file] [--version]
       [--help] command [arg...]


Are there any additional things I need to do before running my job?

Thank you.

Best,
Svetlana
