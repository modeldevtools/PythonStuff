I have another ticket open, but this is completely unrelated to that.

How do I use Gaussian on Comet? I see that versions 09.D.01 and 16.B.01 are "available", but neither of them seems to actually work when loaded in:

$ module purge
$ module load gaussian/16.B.01 
$ which g16
/usr/bin/which: no g16 in (/opt/gaussian/16.B.01/g16:/home/tburgin/miniconda3/bin:/usr/lib64/qt-3.3/bin:/usr/local/bin:/bin:/usr/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/opt/sdsc/bin:/opt/sdsc/sbin:/opt/ibutils/bin:/usr/java/latest/bin:/opt/pdsh/bin:/opt/rocks/bin:/opt/rocks/sbin:/home/tburgin/bin)
$ cd $g16root
-bash: cd: /opt/gaussian/16.B.01: Permission denied

What's up? Sorry if there's documentation somewhere that I failed to turn up. Thanks!
