Dear Sir/Madam,

I am a user of Comet and my account name is myuan12. While I submitted my
Gaussian jobs, my request was denied. Could you please check if there is
any problem about my account? Should I be added into the Gaussian Group to
submit my jobs?

Also, I have unloaded Gaussian 09 in my environment and loaded Gaussian 16,
does it mean that once I submit my jobs, they will run in Gaussian 16?

Thank you very much!

Best regards,
Mingbin Yuan
