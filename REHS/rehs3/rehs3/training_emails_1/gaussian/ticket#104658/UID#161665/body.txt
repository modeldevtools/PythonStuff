Hello,

I am a first year PhD student at the University of Pennsylvania, working under the guidance of Professor Kozlowski. My lab says that I should be using Gaussian 16, while I believe I am currently using Gaussian 9. Would it be possible for my account to run under Gaussian 16? 

Thank you so much in advance!
