We run Gaussian09 calculations in our group and recently all of the members have been experiencing the same problem: jobs have continued to fail based on a "Convergence criterion not met." error. Increasing the max cycle has not helped. This seems to be a problem with Gaussian and not Comet, but I was wondering if you have any idea what could be causing this sudden stream of errors. Any suggestions or troubleshooting help would be greatly appreciated.
