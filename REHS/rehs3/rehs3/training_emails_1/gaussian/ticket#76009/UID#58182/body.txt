Good day.

I am working with pcallis (PI) on his project.  This is my first time using comet, although I worked before on trestles and on gordon, from which my '.bashrc'  file originates.

I tried to submit a job that pcallis completed successfully yesterday.  When I did so, I received the following error message:

+++
slurmstepd: Unable to create TMPDIR [/phase1/pmuino/gtemp]: No such file or directory

I suspect that I may not have set my system properly to run gaussian (I do have the "load module gaussian command" included in my .bashrc file and I have tried also copying pcallis' .bashrc file), but I have not been able to locate the issue.  Could you help me to identify the problem that is causing this, please?

Thanks

Pedro
