Hi:

For a couple of weeks now, Gaussian jobs periodically fail because the executable is not found:

/var/spool/slurmd/job20540283/slurm_script: line 24: g16: command not found 

(of course, the script has "module load gaussian/16.B.01" in it). 

other times, it works fine. However, it happens more frequently lately. 

Thanks, 
-Qadir 

(the submission script is ~qadir/bin/qg )
