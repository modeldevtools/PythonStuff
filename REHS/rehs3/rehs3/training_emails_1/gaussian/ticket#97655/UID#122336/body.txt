Hi, 

This is related to my educational allocation TG-CHE180070. A student in my class, Maria Trivino, is not able to access Gaussian on Comet. Her Comet user name is mtrivin1. According to a previous request I had submitted, she should be able to access Gaussian on Comet. I have attached the error message she is getting. Can you please look into this?

Thanks.

Puja
