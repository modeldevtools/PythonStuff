I have a trial account on Comet.  I've loaded the gaussian/09.D.01 module and can see it in my path, but using which g09 doesn't give me a path to the executable, and the example script in /share/apps/examples/GAUSSIAN/09_revD doesn't work.  Is there a user's agreement that I need to sign, or is there something else I need to do?  Any help would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks!
