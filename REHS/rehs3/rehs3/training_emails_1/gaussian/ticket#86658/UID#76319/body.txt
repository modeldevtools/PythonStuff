Hi there,

I'm trying to run some Gaussian calculations that require Revision D. Weirdly, it looks like my calculations used to run with this revision, but now they're being run using Revision C. I'm not sure where to change this. Here's an example job file that I would use:

#!/bin/bash
#SBATCH --partition=shared 
#SBATCH --nodes=1  
#SBATCH --ntasks-per-node=16  
#SBATCH --mail-type=END,FAIL
#SBATCH --mail-user=share@ucdavis.edu
#SBATCH --export=ALL  
#SBATCH -t 48:00:00  
export my_file=file.com
      . /etc/profile.d/modules.sh
      module load gaussian
      export GAUSS_SCRDIR=/scratch/${USER}/${SLURM_JOB_ID}
      g09 < file.com > file.log

... but I don't see where in the job file I could change the Gaussian revision used. Any help would be much appreciated, thank you!

Best,
Stephanie
