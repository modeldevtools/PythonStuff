Dear Admin,

I am testing Comet under a trial allocation: I am currently unable to access the Gaussian executables or read the gaussian installation directory. As far as I understand, my home institution (Purdue) has a campus-wide license for Gaussian, and will it be possible for you to extend this access via Comet?

Regards,
Pradeep Gurunathan.
