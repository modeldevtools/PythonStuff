Hi, I have my openFoam case running in SDSC-comet. The job is *not* running on the global filesystems rather copyied to local scratch on the compute nodes. I can*not* see any updates in the main processor directories. If I need to check processor directories of the runs I have to ssh to the compute nodes while my job is running and look in the /scratch/$USER/$SLURM_JOBID directory.

Now if I want to copy/transfer the processor directories using globus, how can I do that? To check the regular run status, I login to SDSC Data Oasis and go to /oasis/scratch-comet/arhan12/temp_project/.

But could you instruct me how can I login to the global file system to check (and transfer) the processor directories (which is being populated during the run) using globus.


Thanks.
