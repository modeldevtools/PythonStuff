Hello,

I could not get access to my home directory on Comet. Actually we have extended our allocation on Comet through December 31st, while the old expiration date was Sept 30th. But I am still able to go to our project directory on /oasis.

It prompts the error below:

Could not chdir to home directory /home/xgewlt: No such file or directory

Could you please help me to fix it? Thank you very much.

Best,
Xuan
