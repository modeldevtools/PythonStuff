Hello,

I just noticed that the folder
*/oasis/scratch/comet/lyrivera/temp_project/floppy-shapes,* which contained
all the raw data, disappeared from my scratch allocation. I accessed it
yesterday and did some work on it, but the command-line history confirms
that I did *not* accidentally deleted it.
