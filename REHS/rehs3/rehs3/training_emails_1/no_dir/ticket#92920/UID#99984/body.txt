Hi there,

I finally got access to Comet via SSH, but it gives me now an error that "/home/ageneste" directory does not exist (no such file or directory).
Can you tell me if I did something wrong?
This is happening to my colleague with user name christi, who she got access a few minutes ago, just like me.
Thanks in advance.
