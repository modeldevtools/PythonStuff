[Ticket created from XUP by srbl226]
[From: Stuart Blood]
[System: Comet]
[Category: Access/Login Issues]
Hello,
I have successfully logged into comet but terminal displayed:
Could not chdir to home directory /home/srbl226: No such file or directory

I changed directory into the home directory and I am unable to make a directory for myself there. Is there a resource to help explain how to obtain write access in the home directory?

Any assistance would be much appreciated.

Thank you,
Ryan Blood
