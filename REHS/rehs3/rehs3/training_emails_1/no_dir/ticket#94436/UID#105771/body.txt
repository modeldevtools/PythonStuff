[Ticket created from XUP by mariob]
[From: Mario Banuelos]
[System: Comet]
[Category: Trial Account]
Hello,

I was just granted a trial account on Comet and I can ssh successfully, however I do not have a home directory (/home/mariob). 

I wanted to know if this was normal for Trial accounts or would it be possible to have a home directory created?

Best,
Mario
