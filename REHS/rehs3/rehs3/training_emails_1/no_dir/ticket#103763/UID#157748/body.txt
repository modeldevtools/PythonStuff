Hello,

It seems that the following user do not have the home directory created. I
had submitted the Add User request for him yesterday. He can log in to
comet but as there was no home directory with that name, he is getting this
error.

Error:


Could not chdir to home directory /home/asingh51: No such file or directory

Could you please create a directory for this student?

Regards,
