I am trying to use Globus to transfer data from /oasis/scratch/comet/ascott1/temp_project
However, Globus is not finding this directory. I have been told before that there is an issue with this scratch directory and the ability for Globus to find it. If I remember correctly, I had to place some symbol in front of the directory path...but I can't remember what it was exactly.
