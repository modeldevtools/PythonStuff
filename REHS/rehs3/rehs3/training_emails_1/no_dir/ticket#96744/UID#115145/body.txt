Hi,

I am listed as having allocations on both Comet-GPU and Oasis and was trying to access my group's Oasis data storage. When I SSH onto comet.sdsc.xsede.org and run show_account to try to find the allocation name in Oasis, I get a message saying "No accounts found for user buchanam on platform sdsc_comet". I was wondering if there was a step I was missing for setting up my account on comet or if there's another way I can get the allocation name for the Oasis directory path. 

Thank you,
Michaela Buchanan
