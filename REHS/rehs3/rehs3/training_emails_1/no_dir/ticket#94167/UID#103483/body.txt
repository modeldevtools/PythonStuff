When logging in to system via ssh, I receive the error 

\verbatim
Could not chdir to home directory /home/moboyle2: No such file or directory
\end verbatim

Also found that scratch directory does not exist under my user name.

I had access yesterday around 4PM CDT and my XSEDE profile indicates a job I had submitted yesterday is still running.
