Hi Mahidhar

Could you check the directory /oasis/scratch/comet/arhan12/temp_project/older_rate_test_100NO, where I tried to restart my case using the script openfoam-run-restart.sb. It is showing error, please check the latest out file- older_rate_100NO.12631027.out, where it cant find the processor directories. I have the tar files in the 'restarts' directory and it should work. The proc*tar files now in 'older_rate_test_100NO' directory were created due to the unsuccessful runs.

Please have a look; I am not trying to do much on it cause I might do something that can hamper the file systems. So PLEASE check.

Thanks
