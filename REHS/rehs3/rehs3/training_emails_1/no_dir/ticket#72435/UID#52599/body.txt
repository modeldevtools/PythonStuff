Hi, 

I am a new user on the Comet system. I've succeeded to login into the comet system but I've have the following error : 

/home/amarcha1: No such file or directory

It seems that I have no home directory.

I don't know if it is normal or If I misunderstood something.

thank you for your help.

Best regards 

Alexis
