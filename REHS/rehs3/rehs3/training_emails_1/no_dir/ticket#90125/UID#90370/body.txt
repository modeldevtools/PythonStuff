Hello,
For the past two weeks I have been able to access the program Gromacs using  the commands :
module load intel/2016.3.210
module load intelmpi
MODULEPATH=/home/amalagod/modulefiles:$MODULEPATH
module load gromacs/2018

However, today when I tried inputing these commands, I got the error:
LiMIC: (limic_open) file open fail
[unset]: aborting job:
Fatal error in PMPI_Init_thread:
Other MPI error, error stack:
MPIR_Init_thread(514)....: 
MPID_Init(359)...........: channel initialization failed
MPIDI_CH3_Init(446)......: 
MPIDI_CH3I_SMP_Init(2313): LiMIC2 device does not exist: No such file or directory
In the beginning I had thought that this would be a problem with the file or program, except that another user in my group is able to access it with no problem.  Unfortunately it seems like she is the only one who is able to access.  Two others are also unable to open the program.  

Many  thanks.
