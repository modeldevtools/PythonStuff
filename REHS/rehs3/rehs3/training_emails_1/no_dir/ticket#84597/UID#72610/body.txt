Hello, I am a student enrolled in Professor Tao Yang's class, and I am attempting to use Comet for a class project. For some reason, I do not have a home directory, despite having an account in Comet (as seen when I run "show_accounts"). Furthermore, I also have an oasis directory. Please let me know what how to get an account in Comet. I've attached a screenshot of my terminal, displaying my missing home directory and "show_accounts" output. Thank you for your time.
