hi there,

i am trying to copy some data from my system in switzerland (ETH) to oasis on comet.
i tried to use the GUI of globus but, while i can connect to the two systems, i cannot access
the disk location hosting the files at ETH.

I have previously copied/trasferred these data (sitting on the same disk) using the 
command line of globus, so i wanted to give it a try. however, i get an error message. 
here is what i do:

i log into comet and run this command line to transfer the file check000450.3d.hdf5 from 
ETH to oasis:

globus-url-copy -rst -cd -r -p 4 -cc 4 sshftp://fm@shakra.ethz.ch/net/astrogate/export/astrodata/fminiati/matryoshka/check000450.3d.hdf5 file://oasis/projects/nsf/fdl101/fminiati/

here is the error message i get:

error: globus_xio: Unable to open file /projects/nsf/fdl101/fminiati/check000450.3d.hdf5
globus_xio: System error in open: No such file or directory
globus_xio: A system call failed: No such file or directory

any help would be valuable.

many thanks in advance!
fm
