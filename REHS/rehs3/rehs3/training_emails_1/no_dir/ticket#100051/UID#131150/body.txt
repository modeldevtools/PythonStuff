Hello!

I am trying to learn how to use comet/-gpu on SDSC (
http://www.sdsc.edu/support/user_guides/comet.html)

I was able to ssh to comet.sdsc.edu, but it looks like my home directory is
not setup properly.

$ ssh -A -X hayashis@comet.sdsc.edu
...
-bash-4.1$ hostname
comet-ln3.sdsc.edu
-bash-4.1$ cd
-bash: cd: /home/hayashis: No such file or directory

I might be missing some instruction somewhere.. but if you could assist me
I'd appreciate it!

Soichi
