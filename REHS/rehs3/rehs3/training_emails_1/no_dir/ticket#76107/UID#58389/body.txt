[Category: Trial Account]
Hi,

I got the trial account for comet-gpu last week. According to the guide, I shall put the jobs files under /scratch/$USER. However, I got the error message indicating "No such file or directory". Shall I use /oasis/scratch/comet/$USER/temp_project instead? Does it affect the job running, such as speed?

Thank you in advance,

Qi
