Dear Sir,


I want to run some tests on the Comets servers  P100 at SDSC . I can get access to the comet directory taking the following steps:-


1: Login : ssh gaihre@login.xsede.org

2: gsissh comet

3: cd oasis/scratch/comet/gaihre/temp_project


Am I in the right directory to request those servers?

Also can you tell me the commands to get access to the P100 servers ?


Best Regards,

Anil Gaihre
