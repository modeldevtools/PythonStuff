[Ticket created from XUP by jmadrid]
[From: Joaquin Madrid Larranaga]
[System: Comet]
[Category: Access/Login Issues]
Upon signing into Comet, the system immediately gives the error "Could not chdir to home directory /home/jmadrid: No such file or directory".  When I did "ls" the home directory did not contain my directory.  I then tried to make my own directory, but was denied access.  This seems like some error in the creation of my directory that I am unable to fix.  

Many Thanks.
