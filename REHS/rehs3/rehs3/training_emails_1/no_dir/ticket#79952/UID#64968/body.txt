Hello all.

If I understand correctly, my user should have a folder in the scratch space of Comet: /oasis/scratch/comet/$USER/temp_project

I've managed to access the cluster but I don't see any folder with my username (raikoh), and I can't create a new one. Am I missing something here?

Thanks in advance for your help.
