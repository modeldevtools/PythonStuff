Hi,

I am trying to make an executable file with Cython with the following sequence:

1) module load python
2) cython test.py (where test.py file contains simple print python command)
3) gcc test.c

When I run gcc test.cc, the following error occurs:

"test.c:4:20: fatal error: Python.h: No such file or directory
 #include "Python.h"                    ^
compilation terminated."

I tried to locate Python.h file and use -I/opt/python/include/python2.7/Python.h, etc., but
they did not work.

I appreciate your help regarding how to make a simple executable in Cython on comet.
Thanks again,
Hadi

PS. Here is my simple test.py python file:

#!/usr/bin/env python
print('This is a test')
