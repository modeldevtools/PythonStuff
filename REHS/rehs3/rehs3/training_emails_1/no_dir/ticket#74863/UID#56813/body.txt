I was told to have been added my account to project kan203 but I cannot find my folder under '/oasis/scratch/comet/' this directory. I typed show account and it showed like the picture attached. It seems I have my account but just cannot find it and I tried to create a new folder use my account name and I was told my permission denied. Thanks for your help!
