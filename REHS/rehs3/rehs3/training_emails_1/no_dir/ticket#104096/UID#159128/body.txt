     (a) Lustre scratch filesystem : /oasis/scratch/comet/$USER/temp_project
         (Preferred: Scalable large block I/O)
            *** Meant for storing data required for active simulations
            *** Not backed up and should not be used for storing data long term
            *** Periodically clear old data not required for active simulations

     (b) Compute/GPU node local SSD storage: /scratch/$USER/$SLURM_JOBID
         (Meta-data intensive jobs, high IOPs)

     (c) Lustre projects filesystem: /oasis/projects/nsf
     
     (d) /home/$USER : Only for source files, libraries, binaries.
         *Do not* use for I/O intensive jobs.

Because of this issue, I am not able to login to my home directory or access it. I was wondering if you had any suggestions on what to do to resolve this error.
