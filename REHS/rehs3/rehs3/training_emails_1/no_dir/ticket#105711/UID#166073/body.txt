Hello,

My name is Michael Wadas. My Comet username is mwadas. I have some
questions about where to store data on Comet. Right now I am storing a
relatively small amount of data (72 GB) in
/oasis/scratch/comet/mwadas/temp_project/, but will soon have need for more
storage space. The login message that describes the filesystems says that
/oasis/scratch/comet/mwadas/temp_project/ should not be used for storing
data long term. The login message also mentions that there is a
/scratch/$user/$slurm_jobid folder, but I can't seem to find it. What is
this folder's parent directory? Finally, the login message mentions the
/oasis/project/nsf/ folder, but when I navigate to this location, it is
already filled with many folders. Am I supposed to create a folder of my
own in this directory and store data there?

Thanks,
