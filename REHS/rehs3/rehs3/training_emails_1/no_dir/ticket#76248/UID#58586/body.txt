Dear XSEDE support,
I have a connection problem when I ssh to comet. After I type in my password, the system displays me a message: 
Could not chdir to home directory /home/lev94: Stale file handle
-bash: /home/lev94/.bash_profile: Stale file handle

Can You help me resolve this problem?
Thank You very much for your time and help!

Sincerely,
Lev
