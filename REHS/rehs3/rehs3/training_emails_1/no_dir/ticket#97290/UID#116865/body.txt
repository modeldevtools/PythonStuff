I'm taking part in a SHI webinar on Friday that has us connecting into Comet.  

They have us downloading a zip file in advance and upon connecting to Comet, I found I am able to login via gsissh comet from login.xsede.gov, but I don't seem to have a home directory  and one does not seem to be getting automatically created.  

Any assistance you can provide would be appreciated.
