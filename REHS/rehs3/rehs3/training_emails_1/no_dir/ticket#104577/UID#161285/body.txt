[System: Comet]
[Category: Trial Account]
Dear Sir or Madam,

Recently my application for trial allocation on Comet was approved. However, when I logged in Comet, I found my home folders (/home/$USER, /scratch/$USER, or /oasis/scratch/comet/$USER) did not exist. And I did not have permission to create any file or folder. Could you help me?

Thanks,
Tianran Chen
