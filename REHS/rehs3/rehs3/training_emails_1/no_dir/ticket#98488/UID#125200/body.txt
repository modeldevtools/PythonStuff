Hi, we are trying to use program dDocent


http://ddocent.com/


which I run from here:


/home/skimble5/installs/dreqs/dDocent

It requires some interaction so I run with srun with the code:

$srun --partition=compute --pty --nodes=1 --ntasks-per-node=24 -t 04:00:00 --wait=0 --export=ALL /bin/bash
$export MODULEPATH=/home/skimble5/modulefiles:$MODULEPATH
$module load dDocent/2.2.16
$dDocent


However, when user ckean1 tries to reproduce this with code:
$export MODULEPATH=/home/skimble5/modulefiles:$MODULEPATH
$module load dDocent/2.2.16
$dDocent


the program seems to hang, writing some but not all of the files we expect to see, and top shows no substantial CPU activity.


1.) should he be using


$export MODULEPATH=/home/ckean1/modulefiles:$MODULEPATH


instead?


2.) If so, does he need dDocent installed in his


/home/ckean1/installs/dreqs/

?


Thanks,

Steve
