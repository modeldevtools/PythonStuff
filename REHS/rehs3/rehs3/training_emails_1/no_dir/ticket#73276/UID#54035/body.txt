Hello there, 

It has been a while that I cannot compile my code on COMET which was getting compiled on other clusters such as STAMPEDE 1 and 2. I am receiving an error regarding the HYPRE as follows. The code package is cgs_dem in my home directory. It is highly appreciated if you could help me out on this matter. Thanks in advance. 

Best,
Pedram
