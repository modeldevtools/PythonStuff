I am Co-PI of XSEDE project MCB160124: Online Platform for I-TASSER-Based Structure and Function Prediction.
I added Dr morteza khabiri (XSEDE Comet user name morteza1) to the Data Oasis allocation (, comet account mia181) a few days ago. Yet, he still cannot assess the folder on oasis. Could you check what is wrong?
