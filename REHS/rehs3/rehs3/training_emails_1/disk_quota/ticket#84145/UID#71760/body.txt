One of my wrf jobs aborted in the middle while the other job is still running. 
See the error message: 
 module_io_quilt_old.F        2931 F
Quilting with   2 groups of   2 I/O tasks.
wrf.exe: posixio.c:237: px_pgout: Assertion `*posp == ((off_t)(-1)) || *posp == lseek(nciop->fd, 0, 1)' failed.
forrtl: error (76): Abort trap signal

My run is beneath /oasis/scratch/comet/xhu2/temp_project/Run/CO2_and_otherGHG/WRFV3.9/wrfchem3.9_NCEP_DOE_CONUS_Snudge_tracer16CTbc_SSTu_10mb_convOnScavOff.2016010100

My submission script: /oasis/scratch/comet/xhu2/temp_project/Run/CO2_and_otherGHG/WRFV3.9/wrfchem3.9_NCEP_DOE_CONUS_Snudge_tracer16CTbc_SSTu_10mb_convOnScavOff.2016010100/wrf_0100.sh

Since the other wrf job is still running, this should not be the space issue. 
anything I should worry about?
