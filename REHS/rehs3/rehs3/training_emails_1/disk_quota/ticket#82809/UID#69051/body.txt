Hi, 
I am trying to copy to SCRATCH a large amount of weather model data from simulations over many cases and will need to access data in most of the files at the same time, at least at first.  I am getting Disk Quota Exceeded errors when copying more data though.  Is this because comet-scratch physically is out of space, or have I hit a personal quota (I am at 19 TB now)?
Thanks,
Aaron
