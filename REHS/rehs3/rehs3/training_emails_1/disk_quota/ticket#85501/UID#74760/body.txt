Hello,

I am trying to understand the disk quotas on the scratch dirs on comet. I was just running a bunch of jobs and overnight they all started throwing the same error: 

ADIOI_NFS_WRITECONTIG(76): Other I/O error Disk quota exceeded
    major: Internal error (too specific to document in detail)
    minor: MPI Error String

I immediately canceled all the jobs and deleted a few hundred GB of space, but I would like to know if this was caused by a global disk quota for all users or just for me. I thought i remembered that we could use the command "quota" to see how much we have used and how much we have available, but when I enter quota into the command line I get the following:

quota: error while getting quota from ps-073.sdsc.edu:/ps-data/janssen3/ for fielding (id 510447): Connection refused
quota: error while getting quota from ps-009.sdsc.edu:/ps-data/ngbt/ for fielding (id 510447): Connection refused
quota: error while getting quota from ps-038.sdsc.edu:/ps-data/nsg/ for fielding (id 510447): Connection refused


Any help would be appreciated

thanks
Drummond
