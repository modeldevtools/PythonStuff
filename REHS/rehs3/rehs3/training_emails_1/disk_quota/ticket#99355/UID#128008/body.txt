dear xsede staff,
on comet when I run "show_accounts" i get

[falk@comet-ln2 LV4C_PECS_VNA]$ show_accounts
Can't write to '/tmp/acls_JW22M.out': No space left on device at 
/usr/share/perl5/vendor_perl/LWP/Protocol.pm line 115.

so can't see remaining allocation (although I guess I could go to web 
portal...)

falk
