Hello
A (serial) run I initiated ended, and it seems that it did what it should have, i.e., creating a specific file. However, the .out file includes a (warning?) message. Can you please let me know of its significance? I'm concerned that the file may not have been produced properly. That is hard to verify since it is a very large file (~1TB), although a in a short visual survey (using ncview) of the contained variables I found no fault. 
Thanks!
I reproduce the contents of the .out file (/oasis/scratch/comet/avivsolo/temp_project/GB_B/Input/blk/serial.16707307.comet-06-46.out  )  here:
/var/spool/slurmd/job16707307/slurm_script: line 11: /home/avivsolo: is a directory
slurmstepd: Exceeded step memory limit at some point.
