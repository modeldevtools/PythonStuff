Hello,

I am trying to map some RNA-seq reads using STAR. For several years now I
have been using the version of STAR here:
/home/jpg/opt/biotools/rnastar/bin/STAR

However, I needed to update my genome version which then made this old
version of STAR no longer usable so I downloaded the newest version here:
/oasis/projects/nsf/csd414/rmorey/Tools/STAR-2.6.0a

However, now when I try to map I get the following "Exceeded step memory
limit at some point" error. I am not sure why. In the past I never had set
a memory option. Do I need to do that now? I did find this in the STAR
manual:
"Many standard Linux distributions do not allow large enough shared memory
blocks. You can fix this issue if you have root privileges, or ask you
system administrator to do it. To enable the shared memory modify or add
the following lines to /etc/sysctl.conf:
kernel.shmmax = Nmax
kernel.shmall = Nall
N max, N all numbers should be chosen as follows:
N max > GenomeIndexSize = Genome + SA + SAindex ( 31000000000 for human
genome)
N all > GenomeIndexSize/P ageSize
where PageSize is typically 4096 (this can be checked with getconf PAGE
SIZE). Then run:
/sbin/sysctl -p
This will increase the allowed shared memory blocks to 31GB, enough for
human or mouse genome."
Any help would be appreciated. Below is the output from my attempt showing
the memory error.
