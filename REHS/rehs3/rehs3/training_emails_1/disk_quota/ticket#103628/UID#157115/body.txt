I cannot find documentation anywhere regarding the disk quota for my home directory on comet. I had been under the impression that it was 100GB, but it seems like some jobs of mine got killed despite being somewhat below that threshold. Am I wrong about the 100GB? Is it possible to increase the storage quota?
