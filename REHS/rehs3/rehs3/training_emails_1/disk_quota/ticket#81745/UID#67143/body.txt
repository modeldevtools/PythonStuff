Hi

Until yesterday, I was able to use the Open Science Grid modules within my scripts and load older version (3.2.0) of R. But, now, it seems to give me the following error:

/var/spool/slurmd/job13824863/slurm_script: line 15: /cvmfs/oasis.opensciencegrid.org/osg/modules/lmod/current/init/bash: No such file or directory
R(3):ERROR:105: Unable to locate a modulefile for 'R/3.2.0'

Script1.sh attached is what I am running.

Interestingly, I am able to use the Open Science Grid modules and load the older version (3.2.0) of R from the command line.

Current Directory: /oasis/scratch/comet/gkandoi/temp_project/Isopredict/Mouse/Edges/RNASeq_tissue

Error log file: /oasis/scratch/comet/gkandoi/temp_project/Isopredict/Mouse/Edges/RNASeq_tissue/FPKM_AdGland_pairs.13824863.comet-30-01.out

Thanks
