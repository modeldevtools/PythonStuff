Hi,
I am using Comet. I noticed my working directory's storage is full when I received "Disk quota exceeded." Am I supposed to store my data in Oasis? If yes, how can I access it? I found the following address in the documentation, but since there is a "temp" in the address, I was wondering if it is a temporary folder. I just don't want to lose my data by mistake. Please advise.

/oasis/scratch/comet/$USER/temp_project

Thanks,
Zia
