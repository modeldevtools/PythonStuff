I am using a Fortran code to extract profiles, and column average value from 8761 WRF NetCDF outputs, and put the extracted values into a single NetCDF file. 
My code is: 
/oasis/scratch/comet/xhu2/temp_project/Run/CO2_and_otherGHG/WRFV3.9.1.1/wrfchem3.9.1.1_R2_CONUS_Snudge_tracer16CTbc_SSTu_10mb_convOnScavOff_Hilton3ReShrubRES.2016010100/extract_netCDF_Fortran_xhu/extract_netCDF_xhu_atLamontetc_4sites_writeNC.f90
Makefile: 
/oasis/scratch/comet/xhu2/temp_project/Run/CO2_and_otherGHG/WRFV3.9.1.1/wrfchem3.9.1.1_R2_CONUS_Snudge_tracer16CTbc_SSTu_10mb_convOnScavOff_Hilton3ReShrubRES.2016010100/extract_netCDF_Fortran_xhu/Makefile

I really did not do much calculation in the Fortran code. I thought this job would be quick. 
But it actually took several hours to finish. 
See my submission script: 
/oasis/scratch/comet/xhu2/temp_project/Run/CO2_and_otherGHG/WRFV3.9.1.1/wrfchem3.9.1.1_R2_CONUS_Snudge_tracer16CTbc_SSTu_10mb_convOnScavOff_Hilton3ReShrubRES.2016010100/extract_netCDF_Fortran_xhu/sge_wps.sh

Anyway I can speed up this job? 
My friend mentioned to me the bottleneck of this job is NetCDF I/O
Any idea? 
Thanks
