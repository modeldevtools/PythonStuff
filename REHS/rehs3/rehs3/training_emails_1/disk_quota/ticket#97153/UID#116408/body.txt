[System: Comet]
[Category: Batch Queues/Jobs]
Hello
I submitted a job using this batch file: /oasis/scratch/comet/avivsolo/temp_project/GB_B/job_Y17_wsbatch
The output file, /oasis/scratch/comet/avivsolo/temp_project/GB_B/GB_B_Y17.19656217.comet-22-16.out, indicates the following error:
/usr/bin/xauth:  error in locking authority file /home/avivsolo/.Xauthority
I'm not sure why this would arise, do I need to change the run directory permissions?
Thanks,
Aviv Solodoch
p.s., in a previous closed ticket (#93048), Marti noticed that this same script ended due to conflicting modules loaded on compilation and on the script. I think I corrected this issue by not loading any modules on bashrc (none were needed for compilation) except netcdf.
