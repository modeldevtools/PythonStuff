Hello,

My name is Aleksander Wysocki and my username is awysocki. I need to run
jobs that write large temporary data files to the disk (several terabytes).
I understand that a local storage on computing nodes is too small for this.
The amount of space I have in my scratch directory
(/oasis/scratch/comet/awysocki/temp_project/) allows me to run only one
such job at a time. Is it possible to arrange some extra disc space that I
could use to write these files. Note that these files will be removed after
the job is completed.

Thank you,

Alex
