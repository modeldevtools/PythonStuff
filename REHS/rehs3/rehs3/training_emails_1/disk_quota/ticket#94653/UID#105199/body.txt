Hi, from past few weeks I have been facing some issues with my comet account. My simulations crash due to limited disk storage. In the past I could store about 20 simulations easily. However, even after removing most of my old data, I keep running into this error. 

I tried to use du -hs command to check which files/directories are eating up my space but even after waiting for 15-20 minutes, it doesn't yield any results for some directories (which I think might be due to huge number of files). Is there a faster way to check what is eating up space in my scratch directory?

Thanks, 
Bhavesh
