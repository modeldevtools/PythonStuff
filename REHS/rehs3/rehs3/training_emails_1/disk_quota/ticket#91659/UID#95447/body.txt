Hi,

I've been running some simulations on scratch and I want to compress them,
however, the last folder I was trying to compress showed this message at a
certain point:

gzip: stdout: No space left on device

I would like to know if there is space limit on scratch for each allocation
or if this message is another problem that I'm not aware.

*Allocation info:*
username: lizadi75
Request Number: ATM180003 (New)

Thanks,

Liza
