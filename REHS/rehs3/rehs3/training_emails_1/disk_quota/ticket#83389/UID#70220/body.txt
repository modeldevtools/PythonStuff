I ran into the error below when running one of my jobs on comet. My job writes files directly to oasis. I keep getting this error even if I remove gigabytes of data from my oasis directory.

------------- Processor 0 Exiting: Called CmiAbort ------------
Reason: FATAL ERROR: Error on write to binary file seg.restart.vel: Disk quota exceeded
