Hello,

I hope everything at your end is going very well.

We are currently working on COMET through an XSEDE allocation (TG-CTS140046) and I had some questions regarding storage (OASIS).

In our XSEDE proposal we requested 2.535 TBs of space and this number shows up on our XSEDE User Portal (XUP). But on XUP our usage is 0% which is hard to understand because we have multiple TBs of data in the folders "/oasis/scratch/comet/$USER/temp_project" (we also have data in the folders "/oasis/projects/nsf/allocationname/username"). Can you please help me understand the usage of 0% despite a significant amount of data on OASIS? 

When I use the "lfs quota" command I see that there is a limit of 9.537 TBs in the folders "/oasis/scratch/comet/$USER/temp_project" -- and it seems that this is for one user -- is that correct? If yes, then why this specific number (9.537 TBs) and how is this connected to the 2.535 TBs we initially requested?

Thank you very much,
Salman
