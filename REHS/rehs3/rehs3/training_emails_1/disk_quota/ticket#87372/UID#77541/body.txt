Hello, last week the jobs I was running were creating a dangerously large amount of files. I wanted to change the part of my script that has these but I get the error Disk Space is full basically. I am not super familiar with the cluster but I think this is based on all the files taking up my space which I was told would be cleared for me. Thanks
