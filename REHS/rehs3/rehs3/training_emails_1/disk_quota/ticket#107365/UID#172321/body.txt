Hello,

*Background*: I'm having trouble understanding the intended use of the
directory structure on comet, in the context of my application. I'm running
SPECFEM3D [1], which has a fairly strict location structure for source
binaries, input, and output that I'd like to avoid messing with. I
initially compiled the code under my home directory and was running small
tests from there (on debug and compute nodes) until I think I hit a space
quota. I re-read the comet welcome message and thought I should move
everything over to my project space (/oasis/projects/nsf/ucb192/jmparker).
I did that without archiving or compressing the files in any way, which I
realize I should not do again, and discovered that all operations in that
space are incredibly slow.

*Questions*:
1. How should I be using these directories? Work in $HOME and move any
results that I want to keep over to oasis?
2. How should I move my files back? Should either of the archiving or
moving steps be done with a compute node to avoid using too much login node
resource?
3. What is the space quota on my home directory? The quota command throws
connection refused errors.

Thank you,
Jes
