Hello, I currently have an advance allocation TG-ATM190011 on Comet and Oasis. The advance granted 8.4 Tb medium-term storage on Oasis. However, I am currently unable to write new files and am seeing the message 'disk quota exceeded' during any operation that attempts to write to a file in my medium-term storage area: /oasis/projects/nsf/sio135 

I have checked the total usage using du -h at the same directory. The returned value is approx. 600 Gb, thus below the allocation medium term storage limit. I am wondering if there is a new allocation cap that has not been lifted to reflect the true allocation quota. My project is currently running simulations and will need access to more medium-term storage ASAP to continue.

Thank you for your help
