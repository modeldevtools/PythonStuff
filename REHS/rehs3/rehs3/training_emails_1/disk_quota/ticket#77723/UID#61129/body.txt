Dear Mahidhar:

You helped me running QE linked with Wannier90
by installing the code in June this year.
The example you tested worked on a single processor.
I confirmed that by myself.

Now when I am trying to run the code on more than
one processors, the code fails even though the
output shows that the executable (pw.x) is a parallel
version.

I tried "ibrun -v pw.x < ..." but ibrun did not work
(means the job did not recognize that this is a
parallel job).

I tested them in my directories:
/home/kyungwha/Na3Bi-bulk/expgeo_P63mmc_PRB2012/QE_Wannier/Oct22_2017
/oasis/scratch/comet/kyungwha/temp_project/Na3Bi-bulk/QE_Wannier/120_bulk_slab/Oct22_2017

single_processor_scf.out in the second directory shows that
the job is running as it is supposed to be on a single
processor.

Thank you for your help.

Regards,
Kyungwha
