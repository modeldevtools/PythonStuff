Hello, 

I'm trying to untar very large files (1015GB) and I've created a script to do this for me, since I don't want it running on the command line. The job runs fine for a few hours but give me the FAILED prompt, with the error: 

tar: unexpected EOF in archive 
tar: unexpected EOF in archive
tar: error is not recoverable: exiting now
slurmstepd: exceeded step memory at some point. 
slurmstepd: exceeded job memory at some point. 

The error statement is located at the end of file in cm1.13426760.comet-05-05.out 
which is in /oasis/scratch/comet/meckhoff/temp_project
The script I used to run the job is in the same directory and is titled "run_UMN.script"

How can I get the job to complete successfully and unpack all my files? 

Thanks in advance for the help!
