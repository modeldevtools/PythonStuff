Hello 

Sorry to keep bothering you but I think this should be the last one for a while! I am trying to transfer over to oasis and it says that I have run out of space. I am supposed to have 20 TB of space on storage with my TG-AST160020 allocation. Is there something I need to do to use that 20 TB other than: 

globus-url-copy -vb -stripe -tcp-bs 32m  gsiftp://oasis-dm.sdsc.xsede.org:2811///oasis/scratch-comet/fielding/temp_project/GlobalDisk.tar gsiftp://oasis-dm.sdsc.xsede.org:2811///oasis/projects/nsf/ucb166/fielding/GlobalDisk.tar

thanks!
