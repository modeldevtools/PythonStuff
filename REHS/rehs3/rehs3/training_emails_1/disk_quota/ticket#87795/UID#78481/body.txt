Dear Help:


I am trying to run program ddocent, and with


$sbatch dDocent.sb


which calls config.file, I get the fatal error:


postdrop: warning: unable to look up public/pickup: No such file or directory


I don't totally understand this error, but does it have something to do with sendmail? I've submitted this code many times before but never gotten this error until the last few days.


Thanks,

Steve
