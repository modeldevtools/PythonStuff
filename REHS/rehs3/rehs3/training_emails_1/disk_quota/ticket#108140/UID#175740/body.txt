XSEDE,

I am attempting to run some jobs on comet that are all exiting after a few
minutes with the following error:

gzip: stdout: Disk quota exceeded.
PID 16056

The job only generates about 50mb of storage, and my total storage usage on
oasis is only 44mb at the moment. My total storage in my home folder is
629mb. Do you have any advice on what will fix this?
