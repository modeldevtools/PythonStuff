[From: Benedikt Kloss]
[System: Oasis]
[Category: Allocations]
Dear Support Team,

I have access to a an allocation on Data Oasis of 8000 GB on project col137, but jobs I was running tonight got cancelled because of:
IOError: [Errno 122] Disk quota exceeded
I am running these jobs from within /oasis/projects/nsf/col137/bkloss, which currently has a size of about 140 GB. I am not using a scratch file system but write to the directory the jobs are launched in, i.e. within /oasis/projects/nsf/col137/bkloss.
Am I using the storage allocation incorrectly?

Thank you in advance for your help!
Best,
Benedikt
