Hello,

I have been obtaining the following error in Comet when submitting new jobs:

*/usr/bin/xauth:  error in locking authority file /home/evitral/.Xauthority*

Since this can be associated to quota issues, I have been trying to check
my disk space usage with the command *quota* but I get an error saying
*Connection
refused*.

This same authority error shows up when trying to use
/oasis/scratch/comet/evitral/temp_project
for storage of the simulation output.

My ID name is *evitral* and I'm currently associated to the project *umn120*
.

Thank you,
Eduardo
