[System: Comet]
[Category: Batch Queues/Jobs]
Hello Help Desk,

I am unable to submit a job to comet due to this error: 
sbatch: error: bank_limit plugin: expired user, can't submit job
sbatch: error: Batch job submission failed: Invalid account or account/partition combination specified

I am unsure why I am getting this error because I should have access to comet. Can you please provide an explanation to why I am an expired user?

Thank you,
