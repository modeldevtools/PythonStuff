When submitting a new job, the following message appears:

sbatch: error: bank_limit plugin: expired user, can't submit job
sbatch: error: Batch job submission failed: Invalid account or account/partition combination specified

I was still able to submit jobs four days ago, and I was added back to the project yesterday.

Thanks,
