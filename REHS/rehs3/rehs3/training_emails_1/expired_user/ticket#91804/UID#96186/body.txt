[Ticket created from XUP by phyhwj]
[From: Wenjun Hu]
[System: Comet]
[Category: Allocations]
Dear,
I received the email from XSEDE that the advance for my submission DMR160057 has been approved last week.

During weekend, when I submitted jobs on comet, I found
=======
sbatch: error: bank_limit plugin: expired user, can't submit job
sbatch: error: Batch job submission failed: Invalid account or account/partition combination specified
=======
Then I use show_accounts to have the following information:
No accounts found for user phyhwj on platform sdsc_comet.

I guess the allocations have not been linked to my account (phyhwj).
Could you help me?
Many thanks.
Best
Wenjun
