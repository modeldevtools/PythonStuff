Hi, I am a new user of XSEDE cluster. And I am trying to submit a job now. After creating all the files needed for that case, I submitted the job by a script, which is attached below. However, an error comes out immediately after the submission. The error information is,

" sbatch: error: bank_limit plugin: expired user, can't submit job
sbatch: error: Batch job submission failed: Invalid account or account/partition combination specified "

Does this mean my account is not working? Or anything wrong with the submission? 

Thanks.

Geng Liu
