Hello,

I have access to comet cpu nodes supposedly from my PI Qiang Cui and I can login to Comet. However, when I try to submit jobsm I get the errors: "bank_limit plugin: expired user, can't submit job" "Unable to allocate resources: Invalid account or account/partition combination specified ".  I know that we have been granted an allocation to Comet.
