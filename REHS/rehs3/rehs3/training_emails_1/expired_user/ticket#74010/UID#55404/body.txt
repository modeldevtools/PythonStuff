Hi,

I have an active allocation TG-MCB160060, on comet for 68500 SUS.
The project ID is umn113. When I try to submit my jobs to umn 113, the error below comes up:

sbatch: error: bank_limit plugin: expired user, can't submit job
sbatch: error: Batch job submission failed: Invalid account or account/partition combination specified


Here is my batch script for job submission which was working previously:

#!/bin/bash
#SBATCH -A umn113
#SBATCH --job-name="namd"
#SBATCH --output="outs/min.out"
#SBATCH --partition=compute
#SBATCH --nodes=1
#SBATCH --ntasks-per-node=24
#SBATCH --export=ALL
#SBATCH -t 02:00:00

#This job runs with 1 nodes, 24 cores/node, total of 24 cores
#Load NAMD module
module load namd

#Run MPI job using ibrun
sleep 20s
ibrun namd2 min.namd 


Please let me know why it deosn't let me run anything.
