I am unable to submit jobs to Comet GPU. I get the following error:
sbatch: error: bank_limit plugin: expired user, can't submit jobs

We just had our entire Comet allocation moved to the Comet GPU but it seems like I was not assigned a new allocation - I still have the old nmc103 allocation associated with my account.

Please let me know how to correct this.

Thank you.
