I am trying to submit this new job -- simple list directory operation (taken from /share/apps/examples/GPU/TensorFlow/)

submit.sh content:
 
#!/bin/bash
#SBATCH --job-name="test_script"
#SBATCH --output="test.out"
#SBATCH --partition=gpu-shared
#SBATCH --nodes=1
#SBATCH --ntasks-per-node=6
#SBATCH --gres=gpu:1
#SBATCH -t 00:10:00

ls

 
and I get this error
 
[andy00@comet-ln3 ~]$ sbatch submit.sh 
sbatch: error: bank_limit plugin: expired user, can't submit job
sbatch: error: Batch job submission failed: Invalid account or account/partition combination specified

The documentation says that I can access the allocation through the --partition flag, but it does not seem to work. I have also tried to ssh to comet-gpu.sdsc.xsede and that does not work either.

Any help would be greatly appreciated!

Thanks,
Andy.
