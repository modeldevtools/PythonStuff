sbatch: error: bank_limit plugin: expired user, can't submit job
sbatch: error: Batch job submission failed: Invalid account or account/partition combination specified

I'm getting the above error while I was trying to submit a gaussian job.

This is the script I'm using.
#!/bin/bash 
#SBATCH -p shared 
#SBATCH -N 1 # number of nodes  
#SBATCH -n 8 # number of cores  
#SBATCH --mem=2G                
#SBATCH -t 1-12:00 # time (D-HH:MM)   
 #SBATCH -A jsu101       
 
cd $SLURM_SUBMIT_DIR
