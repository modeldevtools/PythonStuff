Hi, 

This is Chunhui Li, My PI Jin Liu has an allocation named TG-MCB170012, and its end date is 6.30.2018. We still have 4074.0 of 6000.0 SUs left on Comet system and want to do some short simulations on the comet for the scaling of nodes since my PI Jin Liu wants to renew the allocation. However, I totally misunderstood the meaning of end date, I thought 6.30 is the last day I can still do some scalings on the Comet. I just realized that yesterday was the last day I can still submit jobs when I failed to submit jobs this morning. We still have an available balance left on the comet, and will run very short simulations. I'm wondering could you give me one more day of grace to finish the scaling such that we can renew the allocation? I'm very very sorry about the inconvenience that I cause and deeply appreciate your help. 

Thanks,
Chunhui
