Good morning,

When I submitted a job, I obtained the following message:

There was an error running the SLURM sbatch command.
The command was:
'/usr/bin/sbatch Run_post.pbs  2>&1'
and the output was:
'sbatch: error: bank_limit plugin: expired user, can't submit job
 sbatch: error: Batch job submission failed: Invalid account or account/partition combination specified
'

Please advise me how to do.
Thank you.
Cuong.
