Hi,

I'm trying to run a short interactive job so that I can troubleshoot a problem with my input files for a simulation. It doesn't work when I do the following:

[nano3@comet-ln2 code]$ srun -p shared --pty bash -i -A TG-DMR150103 -t 00:10:00
srun: error: bank_limit plugin: expired user, can't submit job
srun: error: Unable to allocate resources: Invalid account or account/partition combination specified

What am I missing?

Best,
Irem
