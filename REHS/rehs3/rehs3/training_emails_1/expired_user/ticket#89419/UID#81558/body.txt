[System: Comet]
[Category: Accounts]
Hello
I have been preparing to submit a job no comet (I have a user, can access comet copy files, compile etc), but now have realized that I do not have an account to be charged somehow (see below) - although in the xsede website I can see the group's 
allocation etc as if I'm part of it. Can you please let me know how to resolve the situation?
Thanks,
Aviv Solodoch
p.s.

1. Output after trying to submit a job:

[avivsolo@comet-ln2 blk]$ qsub ConcatCFSRcomet.pbs 
There was an error running the SLURM sbatch command.
The command was:
'/usr/bin/sbatch ConcatCFSRcomet.pbs  2>&1'
and the output was:
'sbatch: error: bank_limit plugin: expired user, can't submit job
 sbatch: error: Batch job submission failed: Invalid account or account/partition combination specified

2. Checking my account by "show_accounts"
[avivsolo@comet-ln2 blk]$ show_accounts
ID name      project      used     available    used_by_proj
------------------------------------------------------------

No accounts found for user avivsolo on platform sdsc_comet.
