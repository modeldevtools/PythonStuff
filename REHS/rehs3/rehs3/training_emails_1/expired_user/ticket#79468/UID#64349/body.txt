I am trying to run CUDA code on comet-gpu.sdsc.xsede.

When I run sbatch cuda_job.sh, I get an error message saying :
bank_limit plugin: expired user, cant submit job
Batch job submission  failed: Invalid account or account / partition combination

When I log into xsede user account and click on the 'Account' tab on the left hand side, I see that I am included the following groups.

1. comet-gpu.sdsc.xsede	comet-gpu.sdsc.xsede	SDSC	srivatsa
2. Comet	comet.sdsc.xsede.org	SDSC	srivatsa

Please see the attached pics for error information.
