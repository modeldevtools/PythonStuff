Dear Sir/Madam,

I am a current user of Comet and my user ID is myuan12. When I submit my
jobs, I was told that I was an expired user and I couldn't submit jobs - it
showed "invalid account or account/partition combination specified". Could
you please check my account condition? Attached is the script I used to
submit jobs.

Thank you very much.

Sincerely,
Mingbin Yuan
