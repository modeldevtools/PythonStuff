I have a trial allocation and a startup allocation in XSEDE Comet and I have been running Abaqus simulation for my research in Comet. So far I was being charged in my trial allocation but today my when I tried to run jobs in Comet, it is giving me the following message;

sbatch: error: bank_limit plugin: expired user, can't submit job
sbatch: error: Batch job submission failed: Invalid account or account/partition combination specified

I checked my account and found that my trial allocation has expired but I still have my startup allocation.

My input files are in /oasis/scratch/comet/faribam/temp_project directory. 

The PI for my Startup allocation is Dr. Suzanne Shontz and Charge #:TG-MSS170024. 

Please let me know how I can run my jobs using my startup allocation.
