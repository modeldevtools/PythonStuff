I have tried to submit GPU jobs in Comet, but I got this error:

sbatch: error: bank_limit plugin: expired user, can't submit job
sbatch: error: Batch job submission failed: Invalid account or account/partition combination specified

I have submitted several CPU jobs before and I did not have any problem.
