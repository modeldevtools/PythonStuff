Hi,

We have recently been awarded GPUs on COMET. 
I have looked at the folder located at "/share/apps/examples/GPU/LAMMPS"
However, I have not been able to submit my jobs. 

I am submitting the script below, but I get the following error:

sbatch: error: bank_limit plugin: expired user, can't submit job
sbatch: error: Batch job submission failed: Invalid account or account/partition combination specified

Can you please help?
Thanks,
Hadi

PS. My submission script:
