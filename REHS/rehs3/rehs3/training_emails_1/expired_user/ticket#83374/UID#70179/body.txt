Hi XSEDE help,

I am a current user on Comet cluster under username stingw. Recently, I
tried some experiments involving CUDA on GPU nodes, but I kept getting the
following error message.

sbatch: error: bank_limit plugin: expired user, can't submit job
sbatch: error: Batch job submission failed: Invalid account or
account/partition combination specified

My account was opened last December and I suppose that it gave us access to
all kind of nodes including GPU nodes. Is it possible that I misconfigured
something or it requires additional approval to use GPU nodes?

Thanks,
Shu-Ting
