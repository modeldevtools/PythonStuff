Hi,

I was using git to clone and pull my files form github this morning. And it gave me the following error

Cloning into 'test'...
fatal: unable to access 'https://github.com/iancclin/test.git/': SSL connect error

The test is a null repository, and it was set to be public. If you want, you could just do git clone with the URL above.

Is there anything wrong with my setting or something is going on at  your end?

Thanks,
