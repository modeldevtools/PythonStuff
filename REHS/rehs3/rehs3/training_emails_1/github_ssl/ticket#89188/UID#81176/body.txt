Hi,

I am writing to ask about an ssl error that occurs when I try to clone git
repositories from github into my comet account. The error and context are
below:

[chholtz@comet-ln2 utils]$ git clone
https://github.com/words-sdsc/modular_deep_learning.git
Cloning into 'modular_deep_learning'...
fatal: unable to access
'https://github.com/words-sdsc/modular_deep_learning.git/': SSL
connect error

Do I need to load some specific module to fix the error?

Best,
Chester
