Hello,

When I try to clone into a git repository, I get the following error message with respect to submodules: 

Cloning into '/home/atravitz/hoomd-blue/hoomd/extern/Eigen'...
fatal: unable to access 'https://github.com/glotzerlab/eigen-git-mirror.git/': SSL connect error
fatal: clone of 'https://github.com/glotzerlab/eigen-git-mirror.git' into submodule path '/home/atravitz/hoomd-blue/hoomd/extern/Eigen' failed

I have no issue cloning in and installing software without submodules.

thank you!
