Hello

I am trying to do download a software on comet login node using git. But facing an SSL connection error as below.

[rchakena@comet-ln2 ~]$ git clone https://github.com/sequencing/hap.py
Cloning into 'hap.py'...
fatal: unable to access 'https://github.com/sequencing/hap.py/': SSL connect error

Is this expected? and any other way to use git.

Thank you,
Ram
