Hello,

I am a new user of Comet, and I am working to set up my account with all of my needed software. I seem to be running into a problem downloading git repositories however. For example, if I run:

git clone https://github.com/psheehan/pdspy.git

I get:

Cloning into 'pdspy'...
fatal: unable to access 'https://github.com/psheehan/pdspy.git/': SSL connect error

Some Google-ing suggests that this may be because the nss or curl packages may be outdated, but I'm not familiar enough with either to know if that is true or how to fix it.

Any help you might be able to provide about how to get around this issue would be much appreciated.

Thanks!

Patrick Sheehan
