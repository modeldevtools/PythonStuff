I have been using git to clone my github repository for the past few years, and as I tried to update it yesterday and today I am receiving an error message that reads:

fatal: unable to access 'https://github.com/su2code/SU2.git/': SSL connect error

I spent a few hours researching this and it seems to have something to do with the latest version of git. Is there a way to roll back to the previous version of git in my local profile?

Thank you,

David
