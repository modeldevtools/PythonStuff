I'm just getting set up on Comet, and I'm noticing that I can't push or pull from Github. Every time I try, I get an error that looks like this:

"fatal: unable to access 'https://github.com/username/reponame/': SSL connect error"

This happened on a different research cluster because of outdated software, and was fixed when they updated the system. Is there a plan for a system update soon, or at least a quick fix for this problem? Lack of github access is a huge barrier for me.

Thanks,
