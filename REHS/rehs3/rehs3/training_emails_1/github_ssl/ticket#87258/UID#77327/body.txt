I tried to clone a private repository with git, and I received the following error:
fatal: unable to access 'http://github.com/CrowdDynamicsLab/UserCredibility.git/': SSL connect error
I have already tried the solutions proposed in https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19045556/git-clone-https-ssl-error

Is this intentional behavior or does this seem like an error?
