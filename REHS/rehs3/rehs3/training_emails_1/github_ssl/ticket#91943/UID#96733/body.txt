Hi,

I just tried to git clone a repostory from github to my home directory on Comet, but I received the following error message if I use the https URL:

fatal: unable to access 'https://github.com/HoU-Wa/CRegal.git/': SSL connect error

or if I use the ssh URL:

Permission denied (publickey).
fatal: Could not read from remote repository.

Can you figure out where is wrong?

Best,
Chaoran
