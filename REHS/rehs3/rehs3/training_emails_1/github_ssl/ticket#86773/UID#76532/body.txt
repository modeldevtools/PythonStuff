Whenever I tried to use git, I got such error message. What should I do?

$ git clone --recursive https://github.com/davidhalter/jedi-vim.g
it ~/.vim/bundle/jedi-vim
Cloning into '/home/sungcho/.vim/bundle/jedi-vim'...
fatal: unable to access 'https://github.com/davidhalter/jedi-vim.git/': SSL connect error

Many thanks,
Sung Beom Cho
