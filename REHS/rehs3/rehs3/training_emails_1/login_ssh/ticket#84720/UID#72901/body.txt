Hi there,

Am I supposed to use the following command to transfer data (suppose I want to copy from comet to xstream):
globus-url-copy -r -vb gsiftp://comet.sdsc.xsede.org:2811/home/chenhe/tmp gsiftp://xstream.stanford.xsede.org:2811/home/xsede/users/xs-hechen/

Here are what it returns:
error: globus_xio: Unable to connect to comet.sdsc.xsede.org:2811
globus_xio: System error in connect: Connection refused
globus_xio: A system call failed: Connection refused

Any ideas??
It seems I can not even transfer data from my local machine using "scp" to xstream. So I transferred my data to comet first and then transfer data from comet to xstream. But it didn't work.

I also tried:
gsiscp -oTcpRcvBufPoll=yes -oNoneEnabled=yes -oNoneSwitch=yes -P2222 f1 xs-hechen@xstream.stanford.xsede.org:/home/xsede/users/xs-hechen/f1

It returns:
Permission denied (gssapi-keyex,gssapi-with-mic).
lost connection

Please help..
