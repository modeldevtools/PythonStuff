Dear XSEDE Adminstrator,

My request for an allocation on Comet was approved about three weeks ago. However, when I tried to log onto the cluster, I received the following error message:

[kevinwgy@ssohub ~]$ gsissh comet
Permission denied (publickey,gssapi-keyex,gssapi-with-mic,password,keyboard-interactive,hostbased).

Could you please check if something is missing? If you need additional input from me or have any question, please let me know.

Many thanks in advance!
Kevin
