Hi
In physcial chemistry class computational projects my two students have problem on logging into comet with their username and password. They can use the username and password to log into xsede.org user portal. The students' names are Karina Santos (Username is karuuu5; password is S@ntos50152) and Derek Leyva (username is livan555).

Could you help us what is the wrong with the logging?

Best
