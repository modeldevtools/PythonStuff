[Ticket created from XUP by pwolberg]
[From: Paul Wolberg]
[System: Comet]
[Category: Access/Login Issues]
Hello,

I am unable to login to Comet. I had no trouble all day yesterday. My ssh keys don't seem to work.

When I try to login from my desktop system, it requests a password. I tried using my XSEDE portal password, but that failed. Now I get the following error:
pwolberg@comp00: 5334-grid-200 $ ssh comet
Password: 
Received disconnect from 198.202.113.253: 2: Too many authentication failures for pwolberg

I also tried the XSEDE single sign on server, which also fails:
[pwolberg@ssohub ~]$ gsissh comet
Authentication failed.

Thank you.
