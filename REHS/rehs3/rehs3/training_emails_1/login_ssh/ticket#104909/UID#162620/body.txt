Hi all,



I have been using Globus successfully for a few months. I am attempting to transfer files from Comet to my universities HPC endpoint but keep getting the error “Authentication Failed Your credentials do not provide sufficient access to this endpoint.” Further information from clicking the debug option shows, " Command Failed: Error (login) Endpoint: XSEDE Comet (de463f97-6d04-11e5-ba46-22000b92c6ec) Server: oasis-dm.sdsc.xsede.org:2811<http://oasis-dm.sdsc.xsede.org:2811> Message: Login Failed --- Details: 530 Login incorrect. : Access denied, user's system account is disabled.\r\n “



I am still able to get authenticated on my Universities HPC endpoint.



Thanks,

Sarah
