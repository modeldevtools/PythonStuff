Hi Mahidhar



I would like to run a java based app FastQC:

https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/download.html#fastqc



I logged in with ssh â€“X ksoh@comet-ln3.sdsc.edu<mailto:ksoh@comet-ln3.sdsc.edu>



Then requested a node to debug:



ksoh@comet-14-02:/projects/ps-janssen3/jhmi/ksoh/FastQC$ ./fastqc

Exception in thread "main" java.lang.InternalError: Can't connect to X11 window server using 'localhost:59.0' as the value of the DISPLAY variable.



How can I run it?



Thank you!
