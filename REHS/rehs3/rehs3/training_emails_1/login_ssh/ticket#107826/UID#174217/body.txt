Hello,

Could you please assist with the following?

I login to Comet server to run Gaussian on a daily bases, however today evening I wasn't able to login. The standard set of operation I follows is:
1. open command window, 
2, type "ssh srubin@comet.sdsc.edu" and then my password 
The command window becomes non-responsive and after some time the following message appears in the command window "Connection closed by 198.202.113.252 port 22".

Thank you, best,
Shimon
