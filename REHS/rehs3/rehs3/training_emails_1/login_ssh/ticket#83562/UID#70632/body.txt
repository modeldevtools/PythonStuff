Dear Help,

I am wondering if the comet or Bridge system can be remotely mount using sshfs? I tried with traditional tricks, but it always says remote host has disconnected after I am required to type in the due passcode. So may I have some idea on whether it is available to do that, and if yes, how?

Thanks,
Yifeng
