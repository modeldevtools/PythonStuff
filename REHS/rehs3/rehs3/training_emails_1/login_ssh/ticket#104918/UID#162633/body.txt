Until yesterday I never had an issue using globus with comet. Now I get the following message.

Authentication Failed
Your credentials do not provide sufficient access to this endpoint.

The  debug info is

Command Failed: Error (login) Endpoint: XSEDE Comet (de463f97-6d04-11e5-ba46-22000b92c6ec) Server: oasis-dm.sdsc.xsede.org:2811 Message: Login Failed --- Details: 530 Login incorrect. : Access denied, user's system account is disabled.\r\n

This has me very confused as I can still log into comet through ssh just fine. Logging out and back into globus did not help. Any ideas whay might be the problem?

Thanks for the help,
Kevin
