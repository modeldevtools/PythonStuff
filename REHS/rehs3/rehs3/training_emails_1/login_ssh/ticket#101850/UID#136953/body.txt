[System: Comet GPU]
[Category: Access/Login Issues]
my account on comet-gpu is kobeliu, I tried to use command:"
ssh kobeliu@comet-gpu.sdsc.xsede.org
", but it didn't work.  But I am able to use command "ssh kobeliu@comet.sdsc.xsede.org" to login to comet. 

Could anyone help to solve this problem?

Bests,
Bangtian
