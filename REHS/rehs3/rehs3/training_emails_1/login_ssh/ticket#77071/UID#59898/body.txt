[Ticket created from XUP by gretchen]
[From: Gretchen Mullendore]
[System: Comet]
[Category: Access/Login Issues]
I have tried to login to Comet directly (username gmullendore) and then tried logging into login.xsede.org to use the single login port, but my password didn't work via either ssh.  It has been a long while since I've logged into Comet, so I'm likely doing something wrong.  Your help is appreciated!  

Thanks,
Gretchen
