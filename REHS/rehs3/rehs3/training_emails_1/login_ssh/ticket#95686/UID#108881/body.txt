Hello,


My user id is sxw0040 and i just wanted to check i am not able to access comet.


That is when i put in "gsissh comet" in the ssh terminal, it shows access denied.


 Please let me know if I am doing something wrong and how I resolve this problem.


Thanking you in anticipation.

Apologies for the inconvenience caused.


Y.s.

Sumedh Walujkar
