Hello,
I'm having issues trying to transfer some files into xsede comet though
Globus. I'm logged in, but when i select Xsede comet for file transfer it
says i do not have the credentials for it. So I'm not sure if I'm doing
something wrong to try and move files from my pc to comet so i can run
Stacks to do an analysis. If you could please help me out i would
appreciate it.
