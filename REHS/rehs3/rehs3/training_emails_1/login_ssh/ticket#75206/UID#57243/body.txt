Dear Customer care,

I created a username (endaru1) via Xsede portal but I cannot use the credentials to log into comet. I tried to change my password to see if that would help but didnt. All my other classmates are okay and some use same terminal as mine. I use windows computer with Ubuntu bash shell installed. Whenever I try to log in, this is what I get: Permission denied...  Please help. Thank you.

Best,
Elias
