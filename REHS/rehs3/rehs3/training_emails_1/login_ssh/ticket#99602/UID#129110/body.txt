Dear help desk,



At around 11:20 am EST, Comet suddenly logged me off and since then I cannot log into the system anymore.



I’ve tried logging in from both the single sign on hub and direct ssh to comet.sdsc.xsede.org<http://comet.sdsc.xsede.org>. Neither worked.

The error is always “connection time out”.



Is comet temporarily down?



Thanks,

Fang
