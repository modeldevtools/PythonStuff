Hi, so I messaged here a few days ago, and they said my issue was resolved. However, still as I try to log into the host "comet.sdsc.edu" with my username, I receive an "access denied" message and a prompt to type my password in again. I've been using my portal password but still cannot log in. 

And I've tried PuTTY and terminal on another mac, but I cannot seem to log in anywhere. I don't understand the issue, and any help would be appreciated!
