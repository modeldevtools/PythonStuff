When I ssh into the SHO Hub, after successfully authenticating with the DUO mobile app, the terminal hangs.

Here is the output after authentication:

Enter a passcode or select one of the following options:

 1. Duo Push to XXX-XXX-3280
 2. Phone call to XXX-XXX-3280

Passcode or option (1-2): 1
Success. Logging you in...
