Hello,

For my DD allocation (ddp309), two users have been added (Thomas Wynn and
Minghao Zhang). Earlier today Minghao (username=miz016) attempted to login
to Comet HPC via ssh terminal (miz016@comet.sdsc.edu) using his XSEDE
portal password but was unable to login. I was under the impression that
his password to access Comet HPC is the same as his XSEDE portal password.
May I check with you on his login status.

Thank you for your help.

Best regards,
Marco
