[Ticket created from XUP by zhai]
[From: Zhongxu Zhai]
[System: Comet]
[Category: Access/Login Issues]
Hi there, thank you very much for approving my trial allocation on comet!

However, I have some issue about login. I can login to the SSO Hub, by typing in my terminal: 

ssh -l zhai login.xsede.org

But next when I try 

gsissh comet

I get the message:

Permission denied (publickey,gssapi-keyex,gssapi-with-mic,password,keyboard-interactive,hostbased).

I also try to login to comet from terminal directly by typing in my terminal:

ssh -l zhai comet.sdsc.xsede.org

I can input "some" password, but it never worked.

So could you please help me with this issue?

Thanks,
Zhongxu
