[Ticket created from XUP by cesium]
[From: Chase Zagorec-Marks]
[System: Comet]
[Category: Access/Login Issues]
I have been trying to log onto Comet by using SSH directly, but I have not been able to enter as my xsede portal login is not being recognized. The specific command I've been using is:

ssh cesium@comet.sdsc.xsede.org

Since this method has been giving me trouble, I have also been trying to log onto Comet through the SSO hub. However, after logging in to the hub and making use of the gsissh command to enter Comet I get the following error line:

Could not chdir to home directory /home/cesium: No such file or directory

When I look under the My XSEDE resources section in the My XSEDE tab, Comet is listed with the username cesium, so I am confused as to why I am unable to access Comet. Have I not been a part of the system long enough to have access, or is there another problem going on?

Thanks for all the help in advance.
