Hello,

I can't seem to connect (via SSH) to my account (username sallec) on Comet. I use MobaXterm, and whenever it tries to connect it gives the error, "Network error: Connection timed out", or if I try to SSH from another host, "ssh: connect to host comet.sdsc.xsede.org port 22: No route to host". Any help regarding this matter is greatly appreciated!

Thank you,
Sarah
