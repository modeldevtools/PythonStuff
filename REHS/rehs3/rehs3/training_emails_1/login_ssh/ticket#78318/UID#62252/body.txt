I am unable to login to comet as linphi@comet.sdsc.edu. I am using
putty to ssh to comet and receiving a "using keyboard interactive"
message which is apparently preventing me from logging in. I have
tried unchecking  the GSSAPI authentication box in putty with no
success. -Linda Phillips (user name = linphi)
