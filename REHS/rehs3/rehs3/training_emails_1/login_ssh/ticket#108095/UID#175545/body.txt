Dear official,
I am a frequent user of XSEDE however, recently I am experiencing problems while accessing comet cluster from the single sign in hub. The following is the description of the problem, 
 [rhu216@ssohub ~]$ gsissh comet
ssh_exchange_identification: Connection closed by remote host
Kindly advise regarding the nature of the problem and if anything is required from my end.

Regards,
Ronak Upadhyay
