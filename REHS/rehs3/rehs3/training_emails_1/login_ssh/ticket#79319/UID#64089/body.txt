I have not been given an opportunity to create a password for my sdsc comet account and using my XUP password or my bridges password does not either. Hence, I am unable to sign on through the command line.

Now with the SSO hub, I am able to get on the hub and gsissh into my bridges account but not into sdsc comet. Thus, I am unable to sign in on sdsc comet.
