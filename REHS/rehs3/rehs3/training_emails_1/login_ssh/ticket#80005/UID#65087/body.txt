Comet has not been available for logins for the last 3 hours.  It now seems to be back on line.  However I cannot log in to the closed account?  The message is that I am not using the right password.  However I got into the Help Desk via the XSEDE/USER Portal musing my same Comet password?  What's going on?
Regards, Dave Close
