Dear XSEDE/Comet team, 

I have got access to the Comet system yesterday. However, when I try to enter my password and access the system I received the following message:

"connection to comet.sdsc.xsede.org is closed by remote host" 
Or if I try another extension:
"connection to comet.sdsc.edu is closed by remote host"

It seems the system is not able to verify my password since it asks me to input my password 3-4 times before the connection closes.  Can you please help with this?

Best,
Amir Taqieddin
