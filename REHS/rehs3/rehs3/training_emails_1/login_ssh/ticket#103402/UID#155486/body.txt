Hello. I am trying to transfer some files from comet to Wrangler.

I can scp to karst/carbonate just fine, but not wrangler.

hayashis@comet-ln2:~ $ ssh karst.uits.iu.edu

hayashis@comet-ln2:~ $ ssh wrangler.iu.xsede.org
ssh: connect to host wrangler.iu.xsede.org port 22: No route to host

Is this by design? Or maybe the IP address is blocked?

I can go the other direction just fine btw.

hayashis@karst(h1):~(git?) 255 ssh hayashis@comet.sdsc.edu

So this is not a show-stopper, but I think I should be able to ssh from
both directions.
