Hello,

I should have access to Stampede2 through XSEDE allocation charge # TG-MCB170096, which shows up in my user portal. However, I am unable to access Stampede2 through the SSO hub. Upon gsissh stampede2, I receive a message that my account has been deactivated and to visit the TACC portal to reset my password. (I had access to Stampede through a previous XSEDE allocation.) I followed the password reset instructions yesterday, enter user name and link should be sent to associated email, but I never received any email for password reset.  I tested looking up user name by email on the TACC portal, and no user names were found associated with any of my email addresses. In that case, I tried creating a new TACC account with my original user name (same as my XSEDE user name, jodih), but the system says that user already exists. I wrote TACC support about this yesterday, but have not yet heard back. I tried resetting TACC password again this morning and still haven't received a link. P
 lease let me know what I can do to get my access to Stampede2 working; I need to get into the machine as soon as possible to perform some benchmarks for an upcoming proposal.

Many thanks,
Jodi
