Hi,
I have an account on Comet and several other platforms.
I could successfully login into the Single Sign-on Hub.
But when I ran gsissh comet, I got the following error.
Permission denied (publickey,gssapi-keyex,gssapi-with-mic,password,keyboard-interactive,hostbased).

Anything I'm missing here?

Thanks.
