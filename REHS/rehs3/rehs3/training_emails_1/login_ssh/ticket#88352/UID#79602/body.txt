Hello,

I am trying to access a git repository that is behind my university’s firewall. Moving the repository outside of the firewall is not an option.

I used to be able to set up a reverse tunnel from my local machine using

$ ssh -N -R2222:localhost:22 comet.sdsc.edu

but this no longer works.  Trying to connect through the tunnel I get 

$ ssh -p 2222 localhost
ssh: connect to host localhost port 2222: Connection refused

which used to work.  Note that I can do this from oasis-dm but I’m a little concerned because the git version on oasis is rather old.

FWIW, I was following 

https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/46235/how-does-reverse-ssh-tunneling-work

to set this up.

Please let me know if something can be changed or if there is an alternate solution.

Thank you,

Tyler
