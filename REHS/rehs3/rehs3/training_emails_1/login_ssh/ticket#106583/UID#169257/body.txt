Dear XSEDE, 

I have a free trial for Comet GPU. But I have problem to login. 
My username is cliao2. I have tried: 
ssh cliao2@comet-gpu.sdsc.xsede
It returns:
ssh: Could not resolve hostname comet-gpu.sdsc.xsede: nodename nor servname provided, or not known

Is there any specific way I should try?

Thank you!

Chenyi
