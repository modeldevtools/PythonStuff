[System: Comet]
[Category: Access/Login Issues]
Hello,
I have recently allocated some computational space on comet. My user name is achal05. I am able to login to the Xsede Single Sign-On (SSO) hub but unable to go beyond that. I am trying to login to comet using the command "gsissh comet" but unable to do so and keep getting an error -" Permission denied (publickey, gssapi-keyex ....". Please help me out with this.

Also, just out of curiosity, I am planning to submit large scale simulations which involves installing a package on the system. Having, I am not sure if it's an easy process to install a software as each job involves staying in a queue. 

Thanks in advance.
