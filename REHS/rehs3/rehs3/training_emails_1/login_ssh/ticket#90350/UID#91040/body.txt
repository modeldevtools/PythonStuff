Hi I'm a brand new Comet user. Followed the "XSEDE New User Tutorial" and can successfully log in to login.xsede.org and comet.sdsc.xsede.org . For a start, I want to copy my program and few data to Comet.
Tried 
  [cpahl@ssohub ~]$ gsiscp -r epidermis-scRNA comet:/home/pahl/	
but this gives				
  scp: /home/pahl/: Permission denied

How do I succeed? Thanks
