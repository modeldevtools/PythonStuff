Hello --

I was working on comet trying to test some runs/jobs out and somehow my connection was just cut (although my internet and connection to other xsede resources still work). I see that there was maintainace last night, but the last message at 00:31 says that the work was complete.

Could you help me please?

Thanks,
Shyam
