HI,

I am not sure if I selected the right category but I contacted to Globus and they stated that there is a problem in XSEDE authentication server. The problem is when I try to authenticate to transfer files, I get this error "404 Not Found The resource could not be found."

I also pasted the email between me and globus service desk here:

Hi,
I am trying to connect to xsede endpoint; however, I cannot authenticate. Once, I click I get the error of "404 Not Found The resource could not be found."
Is there any solution for this? 
Thanks,
