Hi guys, I have a startup allocation for both comet and comet-gpu but I
cannot login to the latter:

ssh damascus@comet-gpu.sdsc.xsede.org
ssh: Could not resolve hostname comet-gpu.sdsc.xsede.org: nodename nor
servname provided, or not known

As I understand from here <https://portal.xsede.org/sdsc-comet>, gpu
allocations are separate right? Am I missing something?

Thanks and best regards,
P.
