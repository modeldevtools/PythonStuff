Hello,

I am working on data transfer performance for a bunch of data movement tools such as GridFTP, FDT, XDD, mdtmFTP and bbcp. I have custom configurations for each of these servers and am looking at WAN transfer performance between different computing centers. This requires nodes with public facing IPs. Can you please give me some information about creating/accessing such nodes?

Also, how can access the Data Transfer Nodes on Comet? Is there a separate queue, or can I pass some attributes to get access to the DTNs while reserving a node? If not, can I get temporary ssh access to the DTNs?

Thanks,
Deepak
