Hello,
I would like to log in to Xsede to purge some data on the Oasis server; it's been a while since I've used Xsede and I am having some trouble logging in.

I have tried 
ssh -l ab08028 login.xsede.org 
with my Xsede portal password, but it isn't working. I have tried changing my password on the Xsede portal and that new password isn't working either...

Could you help me get access? Thank you so much!

Annabel Beichman
