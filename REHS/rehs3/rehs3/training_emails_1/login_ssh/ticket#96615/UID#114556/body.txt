I am a new user with a trial account on comet.
I want to scp from a tacc account on stampede2 or use sftp with winscp to copy files to my comet home page.
I've tried what I think should work but it does not work.
Can someone please tell me the details of how to get these things to work and also explain to me why these answers are not available in the documentation?
