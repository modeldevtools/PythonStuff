Hi!
I'm trying to move data from our project NFS storage on TSCC to Cornell University's cluster 
Which end point should I select for accessing our directory on TSCC?
It is /projects/ps-palmer

When I login using my xsede account I get the following error:
Authentication failed. Only members of active XSEDE projects can log in.


Can you please look into this?
Thank you!
