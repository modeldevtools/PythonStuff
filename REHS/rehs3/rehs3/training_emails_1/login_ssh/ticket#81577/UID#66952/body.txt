I have been unable to make an SFTP connection to the XSEDE and Comet systems and thus have not been able to transfer files. I saw that SFTP was one of the recommended ways of doing this, so I'm not sure what the issue is or what I am doing wrong. I am connecting through terminal on a mac laptop. Thanks.
