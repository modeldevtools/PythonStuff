Dear Sir/ Madam, 

We have a general question about the login and hope you could help us out.
 
We submitted a Trial allocation request last week, and got approved (tickets.xsede.org #94245). We then approach the resources by using: 
ssh bopang@comet.sdsc.xsede.org  ,   and provide the XUP password, but the authentification failed. Is it possible to provide some help and advice? Very appreciated. 


Thanks,

Bo Pang
