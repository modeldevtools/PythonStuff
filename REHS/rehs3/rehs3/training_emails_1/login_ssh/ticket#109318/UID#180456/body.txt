[From: Sheridan Green]
[System: Comet GPU]
[Category: Accounts]
I was awarded a startup allocation for Comet GPU, but I'm unable to sign into Comet via the XSEDE single sign-on portal, i.e. typing `gsissh comet` yields:
[sbg@ssohub ~]$ gsissh comet
Permission denied (publickey,gssapi-keyex,gssapi-with-mic,password,keyboard-interactive,hostbased).

I just would like to get a login account setup so I can start working on Comet. Thanks!
