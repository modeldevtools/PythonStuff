Hi XSEDE,

I have a trial account on Comet-GPU but can’t seem to figure out how to log in there. I signed up for two factor authentication via DUO and am able to connect to other systems via gsissh there, e.g. stampede2.  But when I try to access my new Comet trial allocation via the same strategy I get hostname unresolved.

FYI, here’s the listing under my “accounts”:



Here’s the failure mode.

[pritch@ssohub ~]$ gsissh comet
Permission denied (publickey,gssapi-keyex,gssapi-with-mic,password,keyboard-interactive,hostbased).
[pritch@ssohub ~]$ gsissh mpritcha@comet-gpu.sdsc.xsede
gsissh: Could not resolve hostname comet-gpu.sdsc.xsede: Name or service not known
[pritch@ssohub ~]$ gsissh comet-gpu.sdsc.xsede
gsissh: Could not resolve hostname comet-gpu.sdsc.xsede: Name or service not known
[pritch@ssohub ~]$ gsissh comet-gpu.sdsc.xsede.org
gsissh: Could not resolve hostname comet-gpu.sdsc.xsede.org: Name or service not known
[pritch@ssohub ~]$ gsissh mpritcha@comet.sdsc.edu
Permission denied (publickey,gssapi-keyex,gssapi-with-mic,password,keyboard-interactive,hostbased).
[pritch@ssohub ~]$ gsissh comet.sdsc.edu
Permission denied (publickey,gssapi-keyex,gssapi-with-mic,password,keyboard-interactive,hostbased).
[pritch@ssohub ~]$ 

I was also surprised that I cannot even ping any of the comet machine names above. 

The one pingable machine name I found by trial and error was “comet.sdsc.edu”. But unfortunately doing:

ssh -Y mpritcha@comet.sdsc.edu

failed too (at least with my XSEDE user portal password).

At this stage I’m out of ideas. Can you help?

Thanks,

Mike.
