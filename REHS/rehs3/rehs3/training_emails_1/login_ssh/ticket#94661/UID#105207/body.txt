Hello,

I am attempting to login to comet using either comet.sdsc.edu or to login.xsede.org via a SSH terminal, as per the instructions on the XSEDE and Comet user guides. My password has been denied for both logins and I have not been able to achieve access. My question is, should I be using the same username and password that I made for the portal login online (as I have been doing) or is there a new password that I need to set up and if so how can I do that.

Thank you,
Ari Fischer
