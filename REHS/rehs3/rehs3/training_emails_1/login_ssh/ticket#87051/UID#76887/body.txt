hello
I am trying to transfer data from comet scratch space to my long term storage on oasis. I have made ~100 GB tar files of the data I want to transfer and I have tried to follow the directions to transfer this data using globus-url-copy, but I am having problems with my credentials. I enter the following command:

globus-url-copy -vb -stripe -tcp-bs 8m -p 4 gsiftp://oasis-dm.sdsc.xsede.org:2811///oasis/scratch/comet/fielding/temp_project/Galaxy/M11/M11_beta_1e3.tar gsiftp://oasis-dm.sdsc.xsede.org:2811///oasis/projects/nsf/ucb166/fielding/Galaxy/M11/M11_beta_1e3.tar


and get the following response:


error: globus_ftp_control: gss_init_sec_context failed
globus_gsi_gssapi: Error with gss credential handle
globus_credential: Valid credentials could not be found in any of the possible locations specified by the credential search order.

1) env. var. X509_USER_CERT
2) $HOME/.globus/usercert.pem
3) $HOME/.globus/usercred.p12


I am very confused what I am doing wrong. Any assistance would be appreciated. I can't simply cp or mv the .tar file can I?

thanks
