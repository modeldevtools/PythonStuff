Hi,

I'm working on some scaling test on comet today and find something strange.

I have one terminal window that has logged into the comet already, which works fine. But when I tried to login from another new terminal from the ssohub, I got permission denied:
"
Permission denied (publickey,gssapi-keyex,gssapi-with-mic,password,keyboard-interactive,hostbased).
"

Can you tell me what is going on?
