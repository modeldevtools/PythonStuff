Hi,

I have a large data that I need to transfer from comet to my local machine. Unfortunately,  I was using globus but the transfer speed is really low and I don't know why? the rate is : 
Effective Speed     3.93 MB/s  only.

I tried to use secure copy (scp) but it didn't work for me , it gave me the error:
 
[bha212@comet-ln2 temp_project]$ scp -r Bashar_1P_4mil/ bha212@128.180.112.103:/media/HDD/Bashar_Cases

ssh: connect to host 128.180.112.103 port 22: Connection timed out
lost connection


I hope you can advice me with the solution for this.

Regards,
Bashar
