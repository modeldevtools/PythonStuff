I have an account on COMET, but I have forgotten the password.  After calling the consultants, I was told that the COMET password is the same as the XSEDE portal password.  However, this does not seem to be the case for me.  I can log into the XSEDE portal, but I cannot use that same password on COMET.

I would like to reset my password on COMET so I can use it.

Thanks in advance for your help.
