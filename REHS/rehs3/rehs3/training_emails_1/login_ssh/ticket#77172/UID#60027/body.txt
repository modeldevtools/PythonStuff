Hi,

I recently became a user and tried to use XSEDE for our project.
We are currently trying to use Relion (2.0.3) for our cryo-EM project but we couldn't launch Relion GUI in the terminal.
We are using MacOSX to access the Comet server.
When we access the server using -X option (ssh -X uhnsoo@comet.sdsc.xsede.org),
We got this error message.
[uhnsoo@comet-ln2 ~]$ relion
Can't open display: 

When we use (ssh -Y uhnsoo@comet.sdsc.xsede.org), 
We got this error message.

[uhnsoo@comet-ln3 ~]$ relion
Invalid MIT-MAGIC-COOKIE-1 keyCan't open display: localhost:71.0

Could you tell me what is the problem?

Thank you so much.

Best, Uhnsoo Cho
