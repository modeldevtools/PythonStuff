Hi When I login to XSEDE, I see we have 50K SU under CC allocation. But when I login to comet, I get this : 

[agoel2@comet-ln3 tf-comet-example]$ show_accounts
ID name      project      used     available    used_by_proj
------------------------------------------------------------

No accounts found for user agoel2 on platform sdsc_comet.

Regards
