Hi Mahidhar,
Is it possible to enable  X11 forwarding on a login node? It doesn't work for me when I 
ssh -Y yfialko@login.xsede.org
(and then gsissh to comet). 
and try to execute any X application I get an error like
xterm Xt error: Can't open display: 
I would like to use simple things like Ghostscript to look at postscript files. 
Thanks,
Yuri
