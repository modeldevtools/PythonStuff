[Ticket created from XUP by tmiller1]
[From: Tierney Miller]
[System: Comet]
[Category: Access/Login Issues]
I have attempted to access Comet in the following 2 ways with my XSEDE username and password: 

1) ssh tmiller1@login.xsede.org
    gsissh comet

2) ssh tmiller1@comet.sdsc.xsede.org

Via both of these methods, my password is requested, but every time I input my XSEDE user portal, I am denied access to Comet.
