[System: Comet]
[Category: Allocations]
I have an xsede allocation for the comet-gpu system. I've verified that I can submit jobs, but I can't check the status of my allocation using the show_accounts command - it says "no accounts found for user kevinbyd on platfrom sdsc_comet." I've found that to be the case both when logging in directly through ssh or through gsissh from the main xsede login.

Thanks for the help.
