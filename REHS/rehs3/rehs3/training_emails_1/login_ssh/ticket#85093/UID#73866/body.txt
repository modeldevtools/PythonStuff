Hi,

Since Maverick is being decommissioned, I am beginning to migrate my work over to Comet. However, I seem to be unable to access both comet directly and the SSO hub with my normal XUP credentials. Both accept my username, but when I put in the password it does not accept it. I have just changed my pw on the XUP website and tried again (I can log in on the browser just fine), but neither the old pw or new one seem to work. Any possible solutions or things to try? My Maverick access seems unaffected by this problem, though I have a separate username/pw there.

Thanks,
Rob
