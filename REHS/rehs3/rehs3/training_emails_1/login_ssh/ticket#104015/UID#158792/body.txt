Hello,

User marjikm has been attempting to access comet.

According to the xsede website, he has an account there as marjikm

He has tried to log into that ID using his XSEDE password, and failing.

He has just changed his password on the xsede website. He is trying to log into comet

with the new password, and failing.

Can you please explain/help with the problem?

Thanks

Jonathan Stevens
