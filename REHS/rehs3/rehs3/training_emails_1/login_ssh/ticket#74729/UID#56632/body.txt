Dear IT, our group at Missouri University of Science and Technology with project #MSS170025 cannot access Comet for more than two weeks. Our IT staffs told us Comet has blocked the network for Missouri University of Science and Technology. Can you fix this problem us?

Thank you.
Best regards,

Caizhi
