Hello,

I'm currently abroad for a meeting with a collaborator, but I still want to work on some of my computational projects. When I go to log in, I'm told that the network connection is refused. I was wondering if this is an issue with XSEDE. Have you ever seen this? Could you shed some light on it? If it does have to do with XSEDE, is there a way I can fix it?

Thanks,
Joe
