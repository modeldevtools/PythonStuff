Hello,

While it seems unlikely at this hour, I thought I would try asking anyhow. I have to jobs that have been running for almost 1.5 days and are very close to reaching their walltime. The software package that I have using to do these calculations does not checkpoint, so if they are killed before the calculation is finished, I won't have usable results.

Would it be possible to extend them by 2 more days (to be safe)? I requested access to the 7 day queue after submitting these and have submitted all subsequent jobs of this sort to that queue to make sure this isn't an issue in the future.
