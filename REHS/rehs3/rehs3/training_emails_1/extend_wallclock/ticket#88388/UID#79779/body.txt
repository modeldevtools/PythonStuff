Dear XSEDE-comet,

I have an award to run 14 nodes (20 processors per node) for one week each.  They may end before the week if the run converges (program will exit).  I saw on Comet webpage that 2 days is wall clock limit.  Is there a way that I can bypass this (or to specify a different partition)?

I attached the jobscript currently running successfully (just as a test) for reference.  Thanks,
John Kelly
