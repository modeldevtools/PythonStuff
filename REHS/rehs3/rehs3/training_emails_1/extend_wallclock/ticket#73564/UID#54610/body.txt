Hi, 

I want to allocate M partitions of processors for molecular dynamics simulations to run the "parallel replica dynamics" (http://lammps.sandia.gov/doc/prd.html). The job submission file is shown as below, here the M is set as 70. But when I run it, I didn't obtain the desired results, however the input file works well on our home machines when I execute "mpirun -np 64 ~/lammps/src/lmp_mpi -partition 32x2 -in  Al2Cu_CandSC_ADP.in " Here the M is 32. I am not sure whether this is a correct job submission file. 

I want to run this job for one week with 1680 cores, can I extend the wall time limit to one week? If not, how can I resume the job after 48 hours? Thanks for your time! 

#!/bin/bash
#SBATCH --job-name="SCandC_ADP"
#SBATCH --output="SCandC_ADP.%j.%N.out"
#SBATCH --partition=compute
#SBATCH --nodes=70
#SBATCH --ntasks-per-node=24
#SBATCH --export=ALL
#SBATCH -t 48:00:00

module load lammps
export EXE=`which lammps`

export OMP_NUM_THREADS=1
ibrun -np 1680 $EXE -partition 70x24 -in Al2Cu_CandSC_ADP.in

Best,
Jiaqi
