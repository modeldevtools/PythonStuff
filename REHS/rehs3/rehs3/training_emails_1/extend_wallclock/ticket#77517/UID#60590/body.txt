I tried searching an answer to this question in the forums, but couldn't find any - https://portal.xsede.org/forums/-/message_boards/message/561129

I have a OpenMP parallel job that is not MPI parallel and hence I cannot use multiple nodes. Unfortunately, I will need to run this job for roughly 12 days. Will it be possible for you to extend the wall time of a particular job once I submit it? This will most certainly be an one-time exception.
