I have been running a program that needs relatively long times to run. I have been running test jobs but I can tell I will need more hours.   My current allocation is expiring on 6/30. I would like to run a job that exceeds the 48 hr wall time limit if at all possible. I would like to have it run ~90 hrs so that I can get it in under the limit for the expiration for my allocation. I have ~15000 sus so this should come in under my max.  Could this work?
