Hi XSEDE Help Desk,

I'm a student interning at Ben Blackman's lab in Berkeley. We're currently
trying to assemble the *Iva annua* genome using MaSuRCA however we're
running into an issue. The job assembly time is much higher than the
allowed time limit for the server. Do you have any recommendations on how
we could proceed about this using the SDSC server?

Best,

Joan Sandoval
