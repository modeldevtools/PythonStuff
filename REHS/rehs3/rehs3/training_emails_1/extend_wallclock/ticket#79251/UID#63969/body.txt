Hi

I've a job running with jobid: 12708892 on comet-30-01. I miscalculated the time required for it, and was wondering if you can please update the time for me? I tried:

scontrol update jobid=12708892 TimeLimit=24:00:00

but it says, permission denied.

It would be really helpful if you can please increase the time from the current 14:00:00 to 24:00:00.

Thanks
Gaurav
