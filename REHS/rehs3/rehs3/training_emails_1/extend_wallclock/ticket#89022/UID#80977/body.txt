Hello,
we are trying to run some Monte Carlo simulations which depend on the history of the continuous simulation. Each simulation will take roughly four days to complete. Since comet has a time limit restriction of maximum 24 hours we are having this problem. Is there anyway the 24 hour restriction can be lifted or extended to more than 4 days ? 

best, 
Khaled Mosharraf Mukut
